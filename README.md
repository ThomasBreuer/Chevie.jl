# Gapjm.jl

This  is  my  effort  porting  GAP  code  to Julia, specifically the Chevie
package  of  GAP3  plus  the  GAP  functionality needed for Chevie to work:
Cyclotomics,   Permutations,   Laurent   and   Puiseux  polynomials,  basic
permutation group operations, etcâ€¦.

I am rather new to Julia, git and github so I am not even sure this package
is  properly constituted; I did not try yet to register it. If you are more
competent  that me and see any anomaly  in this package, please write me or
make a pull request.
