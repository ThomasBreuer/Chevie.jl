If you are more competent  that me and see anything to  be improved in this package, please write me or make a pull request.\n\nInstalling\n\nTo install this package, at the Julia command line:\n\nenter package mode with ]\ndo the command\n\n(@v1.6) pkg> add \"https://github.com/jmichel7/Gapjm.jl\"\n\nexit package mode with backspace and then do\n\njulia> using Gapjm\n\nand you are set up.\n\nTo update later to the latest version, do\n\n(@v1.6) pkg> update Gapjm\n\nThis  package  requires julia  1.6  or  later.  It  currently  contains  as infrastructure:\n\npermutations\ncyclotomic numbers\ncombinatorics\nlinear algebra on any field/ring\nposets\ncyclotomic polynomials\nsigned permutations\nfinite fields\ngroups\npermutation groups\n\nfor  permutation groups I have  often replaced the sophisticated algorithms of  GAP by naive but  easy to write methods  only suitable for small groups (sufficient  for the  rest of  the package  but maybe  not for your needs). Otherwise  the  code  for  infrastructure  is  often  competitive with GAP, despite  being much shorter (often 100 lines of Julia replace 1000 lines of C); I am sure there are more optimisations possible. Any comments about the code and the design are welcome.\n\nThis  package contains about 90% of Chevie functionality, ported from Gap3. The  function gap can help you discover the equivalent functionality to a Gap3  function:  it  takes  a  string  and  gives you Julia translations of functions in Gap3 which match this string.\n\njulia> gap(\"words\")\nCoxeterWords(W[,l])      =>  word.(Ref(W),elements(W[,l])\nGarsideWords             =>  elements\nCharRepresentationWords  =>  traces_words_mats\n\nThen you can call on-line help on the discovered functions.\n\nThe data library of Chevie has been automatically ported by a transpiler so its code is \"strange\". Otherwise the code in this package is often 10 times faster  than the  equivalent GAP3  Chevie code  (after the maddeningly long compilation time on first execution).\n\nI  tried that  as many  submodules as  possible in  my package  can be used independently  of the rest, thus could be independent packages. This is the case for the modules Combinat, Groups, Perms and Util, which can be used  stand-alone. In addition modules MatInt, Posets, FFields can be used  stand-alone except they each use one  or two functions from Util. I already  registered  as  independent  packages  UsingMerge, ModuleElts, LaurentPolynomials,  PuiseuxPolynomials, CyclotomicNumbers  which are used here –- you should look at their documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"","page":"Gapjm Documentation","title":"Gapjm Documentation","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"#Permutations","page":"Gapjm Documentation","title":"Permutations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Gapjm Documentation","title":"Gapjm Documentation","text":"Perms\nPerm\nPerm(::Integer...)\nPerm(::AbstractVector,::AbstractVector)\n@perm_str\nlargest_moved_point(::Perm)\nsmallest_moved_point\nBase.:^(::AbstractVector,::Perm) \nsortPerm\nPerms.orbit\nPerms.orbits\nPerms.order\ncycles\ncycletype\nsupport\nsign\nBase.Matrix(::Perm,n)\nBase.:^(::AbstractMatrix,::Perm)\nrestricted(::Perm,::AbstractVector{<:Integer})\nreflength(::Perm)\nmappingPerm","category":"page"},{"location":"#Gapjm.Perms","page":"Gapjm Documentation","title":"Gapjm.Perms","text":"This  module implements permutations with the  same semantics as in the GAP language.\n\nPerms  are permutations  of the  set 1:n,  represented internally  as a vector  of n  integers holding  the images  of 1:n.  The integer n is called  the degree  of the  permutation; two  permutations are equal if and only  if they move the same points in  the same way, so two permutations of different  degree can be equal; the degree is thus an implementation detail so  usually  it  should  not  be  used.  One should rather use the function largest_moved_point.\n\nThis follows the GAP design: it is possible to multiply, or to store in the same  group,  permutations  of  different  degrees;  this is implemented by promoting both to the higher degree. Slightly different is the MAGMA design where any permutation has to belong to a group and the degree is determined by  that group; then multiplication of permutations within a given group is (very  slightly) faster, but it is  more difficult to multiply permutations coming  from different groups, like  a group and one  of its subgroups.\n\nThe default constructor for a permutation uses the list of images of 1:n, like  Perm([2,3,1,5,4]).  Often  it  is  more  convenient  to  use  cycle decompositions:    the   above   permutation    has   cycle   decomposition (1,2,3)(4,5)    thus   can   be    written   Perm(1,2,3)*Perm(4,5)   or perm\"(1,2,3)(4,5)\" (this last form can parse a GAP permutation). The list of  images of 1:n can  be recovered from the  permutation by the function vec;  note  that  equal  permutations  with  different  degrees will have different vec.\n\nThe  complete type of a permutation  is Perm{T} where T<:Integer, where Vector{T}  is the type of the vector which holds the image of 1:n. This can  be used to save space or  time. For instance Perm{UInt8} can be used for  Weyl groups of rank≤8 since they permute  at most 240 roots. If T is not  specified we  take it  to be  Int16 since  this is a good compromise between   speed,  compactness  and  possible  size  of  n.  One  can  mix permutations of different integer types; they are promoted to the wider one when multiplying.\n\nExamples of operations with permutations\n\njulia> a=Perm(1,2,3)\n(1,2,3)\n\njulia> vec(a)\n3-element Vector{Int16}:\n 2\n 3\n 1\n\njulia> a==Perm(vec(a))\ntrue\n\njulia> b=Perm(1,2,3,4)\n(1,2,3,4)\n\njulia> a*b     # product\n(1,3,2,4)\n\njulia> inv(a)  # inverse\n(1,3,2)\n\njulia> a/b     # quotient  a*inv(b)\n(3,4)\n\njulia> a\\b     # left quotient inv(a)*b\n(1,4)\n\njulia> a^b     # conjugation inv(b)*a*b\n(2,3,4)\n\njulia> b^2     # square\n(1,3)(2,4)\n\njulia> 1^a     # image by a of point 1\n2\n\njulia> one(a)  # trivial permutation\n()\n\njulia> sign(a) # signature of permutation\n1\n\njulia> order(a) # order (least trivial power) of permutation\n3\n\njulia> largest_moved_point(a)\n3\n\njulia> smallest_moved_point(a)\n1\n\njulia> Perm{Int8}(a) # convert a to Perm{Int8}\nPerm{Int8}: (1,2,3)\n\njulia> Matrix(b)  # permutation matrix of b\n4×4 Matrix{Bool}:\n 0  1  0  0\n 0  0  1  0\n 0  0  0  1\n 1  0  0  0\n\njulia> rand(Perm,10)\n(1,8,4,2,9,7,5,10,3,6)\n\nPerms have methods copy, hash, ==, so they can be keys in hashes or elements  of sets; two permutations are equal  if they move the same points to  the same images.

It is true (but a non-trivial theorem) that in a Coxeter group the  order of st is exactly m(s,t), thus a Coxeter group is the same as a  Coxeter system, that is a pair (W,S)  of a group W and a set S⊂W of  involutions, such  that the  group is  presented by  generators S and relations  describing the order  of the product  of two elements  of S. A Coxeter group has a natural representation, its reflection representation, on a real vector space V of dimension length(S) (which is  the  Coxeter  rank  of  W),  where  each  element  of  S  acts as a reflection; the faithfulness of this representation in the main argument to prove  that the order of st is  exactly m(s,t). Thus Coxeter groups are real  reflection  groups.  The  converse  need  not  be  true if the set of reflecting  hyperplanes has  bad topological  properties, but  it turns out that  finite Coxeter groups are the  same as finite real reflection groups. The   possible  Coxeter  matrices  for  finite  Coxeter  groups  have  been completely  classified,  see  the  Weyl  module; the corresponding finite groups play a deep role in several areas of mathematics.\n\nCoxeter  groups  have  a  nice  solution  to the word problem. The length l(w)  of an element  w∈ W is  the minimum number  of elements of S of which it is a product (since the elements of S are involutions, we do not need inverses). An expression of w of minimal length is called a reduced word  for w. The main property of  reduced words is the exchange lemma which  states that if s₁…sₖ is a  reduced word for w (thusk=l(w)) and s∈  S is such that l(sw)≤l(w) then one  of the sᵢ in the word for w can be deleted to obtain a reduced word for sw. Thus given s∈ S and w∈ W,  either l(sw)=l(w)+1 or  l(sw)=l(w)-1 and we  say in this last case that  s belongs to  the left descent  set of w.  The computation of a reduced  word for an element, and other  word problems, are easy if we know how  to multiply elements  and the left  descent sets. In  each case of the Coxeter  groups that we implement, the left  descent set is easy to compute (see  e.g.  'CoxSym'  below),  so  this  suggests  how to deal with Coxeter groups generically:\n\nThe  type  CoxeterGroup  is  an  abstract  type;  an  actual struct which implements it must define a function\n\nisleftdescent(W,w,i) which tells whether the       i-th element of S is in the left descending set of w.\n\nthe other functions needed in an instance of a Coxeter group are\n\ngens(W) which returns the set S (the list of Coxeter generators)\nnref(W) which  returns the  number of  reflections of  W, if  W is  finite or nothing if W is infinite\n\nIt  should  be  noted  that  a  Coxeter  group  can  be any kind of group implementing the above functions.\n\nBecause  of the  easy solution  of the  word problem  in Coxeter  groups, a convenient  way  to  represent  their  elements  is as words in the Coxeter generators. They are represented as lists of integers in 1:length(S). The functions  'word' and 'W(...)' will do the conversion between Coxeter words and elements of the group.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> W=CoxSym(4)\n𝔖 ₄\n\njulia> p=W(1,3,2,1,3)\nPerm{UInt8}: (1,4)\n\njulia> word(W,p)\n5-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 2\n 1\n\nWe  notice that the word we started with and the one that we ended up with, are not the same, though they represent the same element of W. The reason is  there are  several reduced  words for  an element  of W. The function 'word'  computes a lexicographically smallest word  for w. Below are some other possible computations with the same Coxeter group:\n\njulia> word(W,longest(W))  # the (unique) longest element in W\n6-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 3\n 2\n 1\n\njulia> w0=longest(W)\nPerm{UInt8}: (1,4)(2,3)\njulia> length(W,w0)\n6\njulia> map(i->word(W,reflection(W,i)),1:nref(W))\n6-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:\n [1]\n [2]\n [3]\n [1, 2, 1]\n [2, 3, 2]\n [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\njulia> [length(elements(W,i)) for i in 0:nref(W)]\n7-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 3\n 5\n 6\n 5\n 3\n 1\n\nThe above line tells us that there is 1 element of length 0, there are 6 of length 3, …\n\nFor  most basic functions the convention is that the input is an element of the  group, rather than  a Coxeter word.

They are in particular implemented as groups of permutations of a root system. The particular root systems  for  Weyl  groups  play  an  important role in mathematics as they classify semi-simple Lie algebras and algebraic groups.\n\nLet  us give precise definitions.  Let V be a  real vector space and V* its  dual. A root system is a finite set of vectors R⊂ V (the roots), together  with  a  map  r↦  rⱽ  from  R  to  a subset Rⱽ of V* (the coroots) such that:\n\nFor any r∈ R,  we have rⱽ(r)=2, so  that the formula x↦ x-rⱽ(x)r defines  a  reflection  sᵣ:V→  V  with  root  r  and coroot rⱽ. \nThe reflection sᵣ stabilizes R.\n\nFor  Coxeter groups, we use  reduced root systems, that  is such that the only  elements  of  R  colinear  with  r∈  R are r and -r; for Weyl groups,  we also  ask that  the root  system be crystallographic, that is rⱽ(s)  is an  integer, for  any s∈  R,rⱽ∈ Rⱽ  (in particular the Cartan matrix has integral entries).\n\nThe  subgroup W=W(R)  of GL(V)  generated by  the reflections sᵣ is a finite Coxeter group. All finite-dimensional (complex) representations of a finite  reflection group can be  realized over the same  field as V (thus are rational for the crystallographic root systems).\n\nIf  we identify  V with  Vⱽ by  choosing a  W-invariant bilinear form (.;.),  then we have rⱽ=2r/(r;r). A root system R is irreducible if it   is  not  the  union  of   two  orthogonal  subsets  (equivalently  the representation   of  W  on  the  subspace   generated  by  the  roots  is irreducible).  If R is reducible then  the corresponding Coxeter group is the  direct product of  the Coxeter groups  associated with the irreducible components of R.\n\nLet  us now  describe how  the root  system and  a presentation  of W are encoded  in the Dynkin diagrams.  Let R be a  root system in V. Then we can  choose  a  linear  form  on  V  which vanishes on no element of R. According to the sign of the value of this linear form on a root r ∈ R we call r positive or negative. Then there exists a unique subset Π of the  positive roots, the simple  roots, such that any  positive root is a linear  combination with non-negative coefficients of roots in Π. Any two sets of simple roots (corresponding to different choices of linear forms as above)  can be transformed into  each other by a  unique element of W(R). Hence, since the pairing between V and Vⱽ is W-invariant, if Π is a set  of simple roots and if we define  the Cartan matrix as being the n times  n matrix  C={rⱽ(s)}ᵣₛ, for  r,s∈Π this  matrix is unique up to simultaneous  permutation of rows and columns.  It is precisely this matrix which is encoded in a Dynkin diagram, as follows.\n\nThe vertices represent the simple roots (giving generating reflections); an edge  is drawn between  s and t  if the order  mₛₜ of st is greater than  2; the  edge is  single if  mₛₜ=3, double  if mₛₜ=4,  triple if mₛₜ=6.  The arrows  indicate the  relative root  lengths (going  from the longer  to the shorter root) which may  be different when W has more than one  orbit  on  R.  The  irreducible  crystallographic  root  systems are classified  by the following list of Dynkin diagrams. The labeling of the nodes  is  the  order  of  the  generators  and  is  shown  by the function Diagram.\n\nAₙ O—O—O—…—O   Bₙ O⇐ O—O—…—O  Cₙ O⇒ O—O—…—O  Dₙ O 2\n   1 2 3 … n      1  2 3 … n     1  2 3 … n     ￨\n                                              O—O—…—O\n                                              1 3 … n\n\nG₂ O⇛ O  F₄ O—O⇒O—O    E₆  O 2    E₇  O 2      E₈  O 2\n   1  2     1 2 3 4        ￨          ￨            ￨\n                       O—O—O—O—O  O—O—O—O—O—O  O—O—O—O—O—O—O\n                       1 3 4 5 6  1 3 4 5 6 7  1 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nWe get the Coxeter Diagram, which describes the underlying Weyl group, if we  ignore  the  arrows:  we  see  that  the  root  systems B_n and C_n correspond to the same Coxeter group. (W,S) is a Coxeter system where S is  the reflections s corresponding to  the simple roots (called simple reflections  or Coxeter generators) and  the Coxeter matrix is {mₛₜ}ₛₜ. Weyl  groups can  also be  characterized as  the finite Coxeter groups such that all entries of the Coxeter matrix are in {2,3,4,6}.\n\nHere  are the Coxeter diagrams for the  finite Coxeter groups which are not crystallographic:\n\n       e        5         5\nI₂(e) O—O   H₃ O—O—O  H₄ O—O—O—O\n      1 2      1 2 3     1 2 3 4\n\nThe  Dynkin diagram can be obtained from  the Cartan matrix C as follows: the  indices for the rows of C label the nodes of the diagram. The edges, for  r ≠ s,  are given as  follows. If Cᵣₛ  and Cₛᵣ are integers such that  |Cₛᵣ|≥|Cᵣₛ|=1 there is  an edge of  weight |Cₛᵣ| from  r to s with  an arrow pointing  to s if  |Cₛᵣ|>1. For non-integral entries, we put a an edge of weight pᵣₛ≥1 where CᵣₛCₛᵣ=cos^2 (π/pₛᵣ).\n\nThe  Cartan  matrix  corresponding  to  one  of  the above irreducible root systems  (with the specified labeling) is  returned by the command 'cartan' which  takes as input  a Symbol giving  the type (that  is ':A', ':B', …, ':I')  and a positive Int giving the  rank (plus an Int giving the bond for  type :I). This function returns a matrix with Int entries for Weyl groups,  and  a  matrix  of  Cyc  for  the  other types. Given two Cartan matrices  c1  and  c2,  their  matrix  direct sum (corresponding to the orthogonal   direct  sum   of  the   root  systems)   can  be  produced  by cat(c1,c2,dims=[1,2]).\n\nThe  whole  root  system  can  be  recovered  from the simple roots and the corresponding  coroots, since each root  is in the orbit  of a simple root. The  restriction of the simple reflections to the span of R is determined by the Cartan matrix, so R is determined by the Cartan matrix and the set of simple roots.\n\nThe  function 'rootdatum' takes as input a  list of simple roots and a list of  the  corresponding  coroots  and  produces  a CoxeterGroup containing information  about the root  system R and  about W(R). If  we label the positive  roots by  '1:N', and  the negative  roots by  'N+1:2N', then each simple  reflection is  represented by  the permutation  of '1:2N'  which it induces  on the roots. If only one  argument is given, the Cartan matrix of the  root system, it is taken as the  list of coroots and the list of roots is assumed to be the canonical basis of V.\n\nIf one only wants to work with Cartan matrices with a labeling as specified by  the  above  list,  the  function  call  can  be  simplified. Instead of 'rootdatum(cartan(:D,4))' the following is also possible.\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:D,4)\nD₄\n\njulia> cartan(W)\n4×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n  2   0  -1   0\n  0   2  -1   0\n -1  -1   2  -1\n  0   0  -1   2\n\nAlso,  the Weyl group struct associated to a direct sum of irreducible root systems can be obtained as a product\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,2)*coxgroup(:B,2)\nA₂×B₂\n\njulia> cartan(W)\n4×4 Matrix{Int64}:\n  2  -1   0   0\n -1   2   0   0\n  0   0   2  -2\n  0   0  -1   2\n\nThe  same object is constructed  by applying  'coxgroup' to  the matrix 'cat(cartan(:A,2), cartan(:B,2),dims=[1,2])'.\n\nThe elements of a Weyl group are permutations of the roots:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:D,4)\nD₄\n\njulia> p=W(1,3,2,1,3)\n(1,14,13,2)(3,17,8,18)(4,12)(5,20,6,15)(7,10,11,9)(16,24)(19,22,23,21)\n\njulia> word(W,p)\n5-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 3\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\n\nfinally, a benchmark on julia 1.0.2\n\njulia> @btime length(elements(coxgroup(:E,7)))\n  531.385 ms (5945569 allocations: 1.08 GiB)\n\nGAP3 for the same computation takes 2.2s\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Gapjm.PermRoot.cartan-Tuple{Symbol, Integer, Integer}","page":"Gapjm Documentation","title":"Gapjm.PermRoot.cartan","text":"cartan(type, rank [,bond])\n\nreturn  the Cartan matrix for a finite  Coxeter group described by type and rank.

A complex reflection  is an element s∈ GL(V) of finite order whose fixed point set is  an hyperplane, called the reflecting hyperplane  of s (we will in the following just call it a reflection to abbreviate; in some literature the term  reflection is only employed when the  order is 2 and the more general case  is  called  a  pseudo-reflection).  Thus  a reflection has a unique eigenvalue  ζ not equal  to 1, which  is a root  of unity. If  K is a subfield of the real numbers, this eigenvalue is necessarily equal to -1. A  reflection is determined by a vector r∈ V (a \"root\") and a linear form rᵛ  on V (a \"coroot\") such that rᵛ(r)=1-ζ. The reflection s is then the  map on V defined by s(x)=x-rᵛ(x)r. The root and the coroot for s are unique up to scaling the root and inversely scaling the coroot.\n\nA  complex reflection group W is a  group generated by a finite number of complex reflections.\n\nSince  when W contains  a reflection s  it contains its  powers, W is always  generated  by  reflections  s  with non-trivial eigenvalue E(d) where  d is the order of s; we may in addition assume that s is not a power  of another  reflection with  larger order  d. Such a reflection is called  distinguished; it is a canonical generator of the cyclic subgroup of W centralizing its reflecting hyperplane. The generators of reflection groups  we  construct  are  always  distinguished  reflections  (in  a real reflection group all reflections are distinguished).\n\nWe  deal in  this package  with finite  complex reflection groups. They are groups for which the following methods are defined:\n\ngens(W): the (distinguished) reflections which generate W\n\nreflections(W):  the  list  of  distinguished  reflections  of W, which starts with gens(W).\n\nNote  that W does not need to be a matrix group. But W has a faithful representation    (called    the    reflection    representation)   where reflections(W)  act as  reflections. Note  that the  set of distinguished reflections are in bijection with the reflecting hyperplanes.\n\nIt is  much more efficient to compute with permutation groups than with matrix groups, when possible. The  efficient  representation  that  we  use  for  computing with W, is a permutation  representation  on  a  W-invariant  set  of  root and coroot vectors  for reflections of W; that is, a set R of pairs (r,rᵛ)∈ V×Vᵛ invariant  by W and such each  distinguished reflection in W is defined by some pair in R (see reflection). There may be several pairs for each reflection,  differing  by  roots  of  unity.  This  generalizes  the usual construction  for Coxeter groups (the case K=ℝ) where to each reflection of  W  is  associated  two  roots,  a  positive  and  a negative one. For irreducible  complex  reflection  groups,  since  we  want  a  set  of root invariant  by W, there are at least as  many roots on a given line as the order of the center of W.\n\nThe  finite  irreducible  complex  reflection  groups  have been completely classified   by  Shepard  and  Todd.   They  contain  one  infinite  family G(de,e,r) depending on 3 parameters, and 34 exceptional groups which have been  given by Shephard and Todd names which range from G₄ to G₃₇. They cover the exceptional Coxeter groups, e.g., coxgroup(:E,8) is the same as G₃₇.\n\nWe provide functions to build any finite reflection group, either by giving a  list of  roots and  coroots defining  the generating  reflections, or in terms  of the classification. The  output is a permutation  group on set of roots (see ComplexReflectionGroup and PRG). In the context e.g. of Weyl groups,  one wants to describe the particular root system chosen in term of the  traditional classification  of crystallographic  root systems. This is done  via  calls  to  the  function  coxgroup  (see the chapter on finite Coxeter  groups). There is not  yet a general theory  on how to construct a nice  set of roots for  a non-real reflection group;  the roots chosen here where  obtained  case-by-case;  however,  they  satisfy  several  important properties:\n\nThe  generating  reflections  satisfy  braid relations which  present the braid group associated to W (see Diagram).\nThe field of definition of W is the field K generated by the traces of the elements of W acting on V.\n\nIt  is a theorem that  W may be realized  as a reflection group over K. For  almost  all  irreducible  complex  reflection  groups,  the generating matrices  for W  we give  have coefficients  in K.  Further, the set of matrices  for all  elements of  W is  globally invariant under the Galois group  of K/ℚ, thus the Galois  action induces automorphisms of W. The exceptions  are G₂₂, G₂₇ where the matrices are in a degree two extension of   K  (this  is  needed  to   have  a  globally  invariant  model,  see MarinMichel2010)  and  some  dihedral groups as well  as  H_3  and  H_4,  where  the  matrices given (the usual Coxeter reflection representation over K) are not globally invariant.\n\nIt turns out that all representations of a complex reflection group W are defined  over the  field of  definition of  W (cf.  [Ben76] and D.~Bessis thesis).  This has been known f/home/jmichel/or a long  time in the case K=ℚ, the case of Weyl groups: their representations are defined over the rationals.\n\nThe Cartan matrix (see \"cartan\") for the generating roots (those which  correspond  to the generating reflections) has  entries in the ring ℤₖ  of integers of K, and the roots (resp. coroots) are linear combination  with coefficients in ℤₖ of a linearly independent subset of them.\n\nThe finite reflection groups have the following additional methods:\n\nroots(W):  a set  of complex  roots in  V, given  as a list of vectors,      on which W has a faithful permutation representation.\n\ncoroots(W,1:ngens(W)): the  coroots for gens(W).\n\nLet SV be the symmetric algebra of V. The invariants of W in SV are called  the  polynomial  invariants  of  W.  They  are  generated  as a polynomial   ring   by   dim   V  homogeneous  algebraically  independent polynomials  f₁,…,f_{dim  V}.  The  polynomials  fᵢ  are  not  uniquely determined   but  their  degrees  are.  The  fᵢ  are  called  the  basic invariants  of W, and their degrees the reflection degrees of W; the function degrees(W) returns these invariants.\n\nLet  I be the  ideal generated by  the homogeneous invariants of positive degree  in SV. Then SV/I is isomorphic to the regular representation of W  as a  W-module. It  is thus  a graded  (by the degree of elements of SV)  version of the  regular representation of  W. The polynomial which gives  the graded  multiplicity of  a character  φ of  W in  the graded module   SV/I  is  called   the  fake  degree   of  φ.

The function reflection gives the matrix  of the corresponding reflection in the standard basis of V, where the  root and the coroot are vectors given in the standard bases of V and Vᵛ, so the pairing rᵛ(r) is obtained as transpose(root)*coroot.\n\njulia> r=reflection([1,0,0],[2,-1,0])\n3×3 Matrix{Int64}:\n -1  0  0\n  1  1  0\n  0  0  1\n\njulia> r==reflrep(coxgroup(:A,3),1)\ntrue\n\njulia> r*[2,-1,0]\n3-element Vector{Int64}:\n -2\n  1\n  0\n\njulia> [1 0 0]*r\n1×3 Matrix{Int64}:\n -1  0  0\n\nAs  we see in the last lines, in  Julia a matrix operates from the right on the  vector space V  of row vectors  and from the  left on the dual space Vᵛ of column vectors.\n\n\n\n\n\nreflection(r, ζ=-1) \n\nreturns the matrix of the complex reflection determined by the root r and the  eigenvalue ζ when the  vector space and its  dual are identified via the  scalar product <x,y>=transpose(x)*y; the coroot rᵛ is then equal to the linear form x->(1-ζ)<x,r>/<r,r>.\n\n\n\n\n\nreflection(W,i)\n\nreflection for i-th root of W\n\n\n\n\n\nreflection(s::Matrix [,r::AbstractVector])\n\nHere  s is  a square  matrix, and  if given  r is  a vector of the same length  as size(s)[1].

Let R be a commutative ring with 1 and for s∈ S let uₛ₀,uₛ₁∈ R be elements which depend ony on the conjugacy class of s in W (this is the same  as requiring that uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ whenever mₛₜ is odd). The Iwahori-Hecke algebra of W over R with parameters uₛᵢ is a deformation of the group algebra  of W over R defined as  follows: it is the unitary associative R-algebra generated by elements Tₛ, s∈ S subject to the relations:\n\n(Tₛ-uₛ₀)(Tₛ-uₛ₁)=0 for all s∈ S (the quadratic relations)\n\nTₛTₜTₛ= TₜTₛTₜ with mₛₜ factors on each side (the braid relations)\n\nIf  uₛ₀=1 and  uₛ₁=-1 for  all s  then the quadratic relations become Tₛ²=1 and the deformation of the group algebra is trivial.\n\nSince  the generators Tₛ satisfy the  braid relations, the algebra H is in  fact a quotient of the group algebra of the braid group associated with W.  It follows that, if w=s_1⋯ s_m  is a reduced expression of w ∈ W then  the  product  Tₛ_1⋯ Tₛ_m  depends  only  on w. We will therefore denote by T_w. We have T_1=1.\n\nIf  one of uₛ₀ or uₛ₁ is invertible  in R, for example uₛ₁, then by changing  the generators  to T′ₛ=-Tₛ/uₛ₁,  and setting qₛ=-uₛ₀/uₛ₁, the braid  relations do no change  (since when mₛₜ is  odd we have uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ) but  the quadratic relations become  (T′ₛ-qₛ)(T′ₛ+1)=0. This last form is the  most common  form considered  in the  literature. Another common form, considered  in  the  context  of  Kazhdan-Lusztig  theory, is uₛ₀=√qₛ and uₛ₁=-√qₛ⁻¹.  The general form of parameters provided is a special case of general cyclotomic Hecke algebras, and can be useful in many contexts.\n\nFor  some  algebras  the  character  table,  and in general Kazhdan-Lusztig bases,  require a square root of -uₛ₀uₛ₁.  We provide a way to specify it with  the  field  .rootpara  which  can  be  given  when constructing the algebra. If not given a root is automatically extracted when needed (and we know  how to compute it) by the function RootParameter. Note however that sometimes  an  explicit  choice  of  root  is  necessary  which  cannot  be automatically determined.\n\nThere  is a universal choice  for R and uₛᵢ:  Let uₛᵢ:s∈ S,i∈[0,1] be indeterminates   such  that  uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ  whenever  mₛₜ  is  odd,  and  let A=ℤ[uₛᵢ] be the corresponding polynomial ring. Then the Hecke algebra H of  W over a  with parameters uₛᵢ  is called the generic Iwahori-Hecke algebra  of  with  W.  Any  other  algebra  with parameters vₛᵢ can be obtained  by specialization from  H: There is  a unique ring homomorphism f:A  → R such that f(uₛᵢ)=vₛᵢ  for all i. Then we  can view R as an A-module via f and we can identify the other algebra to R _A H.\n\nThe  elements {T_w∣w∈ W} actually form an  R-basis of H if one of the uₛᵢ  is invertible for all s. The  structure constants in that basis is obtained  as  follows.  To  multiply  T_v  by  T_w,  choose  a  reduced expression for v, say v=s_1 ⋯ s_k and apply inductively the formula:\n\nT_sT_w=T_sw               if l(sw)=l(w)+1\n\nT_sT_w=-uₛ₀uₛ₁T_sw+(uₛ₀+uₛ₁)T_w if l(sw)=l(w)-1.\n\nIf all s we have uₛ₀=q, uₛ₁=-1 then we call the corresponding algebra the one-parameter or Spetsial Iwahori-Hecke algebra associated with W; it can  be obtained with the  simplified call 'hecke(W,q)'. Certain invariants of  the irreducible characters of  this algebra play a  special role in the representation  theory of the underlying  finite Coxeter groups, namely the a- and A-invariants. For basic properties of Iwahori-Hecke algebras and their  relevance to the representation theory of finite groups of Lie type, see for example Curtis and Reiner 1987, Sections~67 and 68.\n\nIn  the  following  example,  we  compute  the multiplication table for the 0-Iwahori–Hecke algebra associated with the Coxeter group of type A_2.\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,2)\nA₂\n\njulia> H=hecke(W,0)            # One-parameter algebra with `q=0`\nhecke(A₂,0)\n\njulia> T=Tbasis(H);            # Create the `T` basis\n\njulia> el=words(W)\n6-element Vector{Vector{Int8}}:\n []       \n [2]      \n [1]      \n [2, 1]   \n [1, 2]   \n [1, 2, 1]\n\njulia> T.(el)*permutedims(T.(el))        # multiplication table\n6×6 Matrix{HeckeTElt{Perm{Int16}, Int64, HeckeAlgebra{Int64, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}}}:\n T.

If  it is a vector with   one  entry,  it   is  replaced  with  fill(parameter[1],ngens(W)). Otherwise,  parameter should be  a list of  length ngens(W). Entries of parameter  corresponding to  the same  W-orbit of  generators should be identical.  parameter can be shorter than ngens(W) provided there is at least one entry bound for each orbit of reflections.\n\nAn  entry in  parameter for  a reflection  of order  e can  be either a single  value or  a Vector  of length  'e'.

We set  Γ⁺= {γ∈  Γ∣γ>0} and Γ⁻={γ⁻¹∣γ∈ Γ⁺}={γ∈ Γ∣γ<0}.\n\nThus  we assume ℋ defined over the ring ℤ[Γ], the group algebra of Γ over  ℤ, and the quadratic  relations of ℋ  associate to each s∈ S a vₛ∈  Γ⁺ such that  (tₛ-vₛ)(tₛ+vₛ⁻¹)=0. We also  set qₛ=vₛ² and define the  basis Tₛ=vₛtₛ with quadratic relations (Tₛ-qₛ)(Tₛ+1)=0; for w∈ W with reduced expression w=s₁…sₙ we define q_w Γ by q_w^½=v_s₁v_sₙ and let q_w=(q_w^½)².\n\nWe  define the bar involution on ℋ  by linearity: on ℤ[Γ] we define it by  overline_γ Γa_γγ= _γ Γ a_γ γ¹ and we extend it to ℋ by  overline  Tₛ=Tₛ¹.  Then  the Kazhdan-Lusztig basis C_w is defined  as  the  only  basis  of  ℋ  stable  by the bar involution and congruent to t_w modulo _w WΓ t_w.\n\nThe  basis  C_w  can  be  computed  as  follows.  We  define  elements R_xy  of ℤ[Γ] by  T_y¹=_x overlineR_xy¹ q_x¹T_x. We then  define inductively  the Kazhdan-Lusztig  polynomials (in this general context  we should say the Kazhdan-Lusztig elements of ℤ[Γ], which belong to the subalgebra of ℤ[Γ] generated by the qₛ) by P_xw=τ_(q_wq_x)^½  (_xywR_xyP_yw)  where  τ  is the truncation:  τ_nu _γ  Γ a_γγ=  _γnua_γγ; the  induction is thus on decreasing x for the Bruhat order and starts at P_ww=1. We have then C_w=_y q_w^-12 P_ywT_y.\n\nThe  Chevie code  for the  Kazhdan-Lusztig bases  C, D and their primed versions, has been initially written by Andrew Mathas around 1994, who also contributed  to  the  design  of  the programs dealing with Kazhdan-Lusztig bases. He also implemented some other bases, such as the Murphy basis which can  be  found  in  the  Chevie  contributions  directory. The code for the unequal  parameters  case  has  been  written  around  1999  by F.Digne and J.Michel. The other Kazhdan-Lusztig bases are computed in terms of the C′ basis.\n\nWhen  the ℤ[Γ] is a  Laurent polynomial ring the  bar operation is taking the  inverse of  the variables,  and truncation  is keeping terms of degree smaller or equal to that of ν. It is possible to use arbitrary groups Γ as   long   as   methods   bar:_γ   Γ   a_γγ  _γ  Γ  a_γγ¹, positive_part  : _γ  Γ a_γγ  _γ 1  a_γγ and negative_part: _γ  Γ  a_γγ    _γ  1  a_γγ  have been defined on ℤ[Γ]. These operations   will   be   used   internally   by  the  programs  to  compute Kazhdan-Lusztig bases.\n\nfinally, benchmarks on julia 1.6.2\n\njulia> function test_kl(W)\n         q=Pol(); H=hecke(W,q^2,rootpara=q)\n         C=Cpbasis(H); T=Tbasis(H)\n         [T(C(w)) for w in elements(W)]\n       end\ntest_kl (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> @btime test_kl(coxgroup(:F,4));\n2.019 s (17905502 allocations: 2.64 GiB)\n\nCompare to GAP3 where the following function takes 11s for F4\n\ntest_kl:=function(W)local q,H,T,C;\n  q:=X(Rationals);H:=Hecke(W,q^2,q);\n  T:=Basis(H,\"T\");C:=Basis(H,\"C'\");\n  List(Elements(W),e->T(C(e)));\nend;\n\nAnother benchmark:\n\nfunction test_kl2(W)\n  el=elements(W)\n  [KLPol(W,x,y) for x in el, y in el]\nend\n\ntest_kl2 (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia>@btime test_kl2(coxgroup(:F,4));\n5.915 s (49702830 allocations: 6.98 GiB)\n\nCompare to GAP3 where the following function takes 42s for F4\n\ntest_kl2:=function(W)local el;\n  el:=Elements(W);\n  List(el,x->List(el,y->KazhdanLusztigPolynomial(W,x,y)));\nend;\n\nWe provide also functionality to study the Kazhdan-Lusztig left cells (for the equal-parameter Hecke algebra).\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:H,3)\nH₃\n\njulia> c=LeftCells(W)\n22-element Vector{LeftCell{FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Cyc{Int64}}}}:\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo= character=φ₁‚₀>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=123 character=φ₁‚₁₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(15) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(10) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(14) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=7 character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(12) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(9,12) character=φ₅‚₂>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(5,11) character=φ₅‚₂>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=13 character=φ₅‚₂>\n ⋮\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(8,13) character=φ₃‚₆+φ₃‚₈>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(1,15) character=φ₃‚₆+φ₃‚₈>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=3 character=φ₃‚₁+φ₃‚₃>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=2 character=φ₃‚₁+φ₃‚₃>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=1 character=φ₃‚₁+φ₃‚₃>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=6 character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(13) character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(11) character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=9 character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n\nsee  also  the  functions  elements,  character,  representation  and Wgraph  for left  cells.

One can first run  a number of standard checks on a given  pair  of  elements  to  see  if the computation of the corresponding polynomial  can be reduced to a similar computation for elements of smaller length. One such check involves the notion of critical pairs (cf. Alv87): a pair  of elements w₁,w₂∈  W such that  w₁≤w₂ is critical  if ℒ(w₂) ⊆ ℒ(w₁)  and ℛ (w₂)⊆ ℛ (w₁), where ℒ  and ℛ denote the left and right descent  set, respectively.

We say that x  is an atom if 1  and x are its only divisors. A left gcd of x and y is a common left  divisor d of x and y such that any other common left divisor is a  left divisor of d. Similarly a right  lcm of x and y is a common multiple which is a left divisor of any other common multiple.\n\nWe  call Garside a monoid M which:\n\nis left and right cancellable.\nis generated by its atoms,  which are finite in number.\nadmits left and  right  gcds  and  lcms.\nis such that any element has only finitely many left (or right) divisors.\nadmits a Garside element, which is an element Δ whose set of left and right divisors coincide and generate M.\n\nGarside  elements are not  unique, but there  is a unique  minimal one (for divisibility);  we assume a  Garside element Δ  has been chosen. Then the divisors  of Δ are called  the simples of M.  A Garside monoid embeds into  its group of fractions, which is  called a Garside group (a Garside group  may have  several distinct  Garside structures,  as we  will see for Braid groups of finite Coxeter groups).\n\nWe  also implement locally Garside monoids,  which are monoids where lcms do  not always exist, but exist when any common multiple exists; the set of simples  is then not defined using a  Garside element, but by the condition that  they contain the atoms and are  closed under lcms and taking divisors (see  BDM01); since it is  not ensured by the existence of  Δ, one  has to  add the  condition that  any element  is divisible by finitely many simples (but the number of simples can be infinite). The main example  is the braid monoid of an  infinite Coxeter group. It is not known if  these monoids embed in  their group of fractions  (though that has been proved for braid monoids of Coxeter groups by Paris Paris01)  and thus  computing in  the monoid does not help  for computing in the group (only  the monoid is implemented for these cases).\n\nWhat allows computing with Garside and locally Garside monoids, and Garside groups,  is the fact  that they admit  normal forms –-  these normal forms where   exhibited  for   braid  monoids   of  Coxeter   groups  by  Deligne Del72,  who extended previous  work of Brieskorn, Saito BS72 and Garside Gar69:\n\n(i) Let  M be a locally Garside monoid and let b∈ M. Then there is a unique maximal left simple divisor α(b) of b –- any other simple dividing b on the left divides α(b) on the left.\n\n(ii) Assume  M is a Garside monoid, Δ is  its Garside element and G is its group  of fractions. Then,  given any element  x∈ G, there  is some power i such that Δⁱ x∈ M.\n\nA consequence of (i) is that any element has a canonical decomposition as a product of simples, called its left-greedy normal form. If we define ω(x) by  x=α(x)ω(x), then the normal form of x is α(x)α(ω(x))α(ω^2(x))… We use  the normal form to represent elements  of M, and when M is Garside (ii)  to represent elements  of G: given  x∈ G we  compute the smallest power  i  such  that  Δⁱ  x∈  M,  and  we  represent  x by the couple (i,Δ⁻ⁱx).  We are thus reduced to the case where x∈ M, not divisible by Δ,  where we represent  x by the  sequence of simples which constitutes its normal form. \n\nWe  now describe Artin-Tits braid monoids. Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system, that is W has presentation\n\n⟨s∈ S∣s^2=1, sts⋯ =tst⋯   (mₛₜ factors on each side) for s,t∈ S⟩\n\nfor  some Coxeter matrix mₛₜ for s,t∈ S. The braid group B associated to (W,S) is the group defined by the presentation\n\n⟨𝐬∈ 𝐒∣ 𝐬𝐭𝐬⋯ =𝐭𝐬𝐭⋯  (mₛₜ factors on each side) for 𝐬,𝐭∈ 𝐒⟩\n\nThe positive braid monoid B⁺ associated to W is the monoid defined by the  presentation above –- it identifies to the submonoid of B generated by  𝐒 by  the result  of Paris  mentioned above.  This monoid  is locally Garside,  with set of simples  in bijection with elements  of W and atoms the elements of 𝐒; we will denote by 𝐖 the set of simples, and by 𝐰 ↦ w  the bijection between simples and elements  of W. The group W has a length  defined  in  terms  of  reduced expressions. Similarly, having only homogeneous relations, B⁺ has a natural length function. Then 𝐖 can be characterized  as the subset of the elements  of B⁺ of the same length as their image in W.\n\nIf  W is finite, then B⁺ is Garside with Garside element the element of 𝐖 whose image is the longest element  of W. A finite Coxeter group is also  a reflection group in  a real vector space,  thus in its complexified V,  and B has also a topological definition as the fundamental group of the  space Vʳᵉᵍ/W, where Vʳᵉᵍ  is the set of  elements of V which are fixed  by no  non-identity element  of S;  however, we  will not use this here.\n\nGiven a Coxeter group W,\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,4)\nA₄\n\njulia> B=BraidMonoid(W)\nBraidMonoid(A₄)\n\nconstructs  the  associated  braid  monoid,  and  then  as  a  function 'B' constructs  elements of the braid monoid (or group when W is finite) from a list of generators.\n\njulia> w=B(1,2,3,4)\n1234\n\njulia> w^3\n121321432.343\n\njulia> word(α(w^3))\n9-element Vector{Int64}:\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 3\n 2\n 1\n 4\n 3\n 2\n\njulia> w^4\nΔ.232432\n\njulia> inv(w)\n(1234)⁻¹\n\nHow  an element of  a Garside group  is printed is  controlled by IOcontext ':greedy'.  By default, elements are printed  as fractions a⁻¹b where a and  b have no left common divisor. Each  of a and b is printed using its left-greedy normal form, that is a maximal power of the Garside element followed  by the rest. One can print  the entire element in the left-greedy normal  from by setting the ':greedy' IOContext; with the same w as above we have:\n\njulia> repr(w^-1,context=IOContext(stdout,:greedy=>true,:limit=>true))\n\"Δ⁻¹.232432\"\n\nFinally,  repr gives   w  back   in  a   form  which   after  assigning 'B=BraidMonoid(W)' can be input back into Julia:\n\njulia> repr(w)\n\"B(1,2,3,4)\"\n\njulia> repr(w^3)\n\"B(1,2,1,3,2,1,4,3,2,3,4,3)\"\n\njulia> repr(w^-1)\n\"B(-4,-3,-2,-1)\"\n\nIn  general elements of a Garside monoid  are displayed similarly as a list of their constituting atoms.\n\nWe  now describe the dual braid monoid.  For that, we first give a possible approach  to construct Garside monoids. Given a  group W and a set S of generators  of W as a monoid, we  define the length l(w) as the minimum number of elements of S needed to write w. We then define left divisors of   x  as  the  d   such  that  there  exists   y  with  x=dy  and l(d)+l(y)=l(x).  We say that  w∈ W is  balanced if its  set of left and right  divisors coincide, and we  say that w is  Garside if that set is a lattice (where upper and lower bounds are lcms and gcds) and generates W. Then we have:\n\nsuppose w is Garside and let [1,w] be its set of divisors (an interval for  the partial order  defined by divisibility).  Then the monoid M with generators  [1,w] and relations  xy=z whenever xy=z  holds in W and l(x)+l(y)=l(z)  is Garside,  with simples  [1,w] and  atoms S.  It is called the interval monoid defined by the interval [1,w].\n\nThe  Artin-Tits braid monoid  is an interval  monoid by taking  for S the Coxeter generators, in which case l is the Coxeter length, and taking for w  the longest element of W. The dual monoid, constructed by Birman, Ko and  Lee  for  type  A  and  by  Bessis  for  all  well-generated complex reflection  groups, is obtained in  a similar way, by  taking this time for w  a Coxeter element,  for l the  reflection length 'reflength' and for S the reflections which divide w for the reflection length (for Coxeter groups all reflections divide w but for well-generated complex reflection groups  not all reflections divide); for the dual monoid the simples are of cardinality  the generalized Catalan numbers  catalan. An interval monoid has  naturally an inverse morphism from M to W, called 'image' which is the  quotient map from the  interval monoid to W  which sends back simple braids to [1,w].\n\nA  last notable notion is reversible  monoids. Since we store left normal forms,  it is easy to compute left lcms and gcds, but hard to compute right lcms  and gcds. But this becomes easy to  do if the monoid has an operation 'reverse',  which has the property that 'a' is a left divisor of 'b' if and only  if 'reverse(a)'  is a  right divisor  of 'reverse(b)'. This holds for Artin-Tits  and dual braid monoids of groups generated by true reflections; Artin-Tits monoids have a reverse operation which consists of reversing a word,  written as  a list  of atoms.  The dual  monoid also has a reverse operation  defined in the  same way, but  this operation changes monoid: it goes  from the dual monoid  for the Coxeter element  w to the dual monoid for  the Coxeter element  w⁻¹. The operations  'rightlcm' and 'rightgcd', and  some other algorithms, have faster implementations if the monoid has a reverse operation.\n\nThis  module implements also  functions to solve  the conjugacy problem and compute  centralizers  in  Garside  groups,  following  the work of Franco, Gebhardt and Gonzalez-Meneses.\n\nTwo  elements w and w' of a monoid  M are conjugate in M if there exists  x∈ M such that wx=xw'; if  M satisfies the Öre conditions, it has  a  group  of  fractions  where  this  becomes  x⁻¹wx=w',  the  usual definition  of conjugacy. A special case  which is even closer to conjugacy in  the group is if there exists y∈  M such that w=xy and w'=yx. This relation  is not transitive in general,  but we call cyclic conjugacy the transitive closure of this relation, a restricted form of conjugacy.\n\nThe  next  observation  is  that  if  w,w'  are conjugate in the group of fractions  of the Garside monoid M then  they are conjugate in M, since if  wx=xw' then  there is  a power  Δⁱ which  is central and such that xΔⁱ∈ M. Then wxΔⁱ=xΔⁱ w' is a conjugation in M.\n\nThe  crucial observation for solving the  conjugacy problem is to introduce inf(w):=sup{i such  that  Δⁱ   divides  w}  and sup(w):=inf{i such  that  w  divides Δⁱ}, and to notice  that the number of  conjugates of w with  same inf and sup as w  is finite. Further, a  theorem of Birman shows  that the maximum inf and  minimum sup in a conjugacy class can be achieved simultaneously; the elements  achieving this are called the super summit set of w. Thus a way to  determine if two elements are conjugate  is to find a representative of both  of them in  their super summit  set, and then  solve conjugacy within that  set. This can also be used  to compute the centralizer of an element: if  we consider  the super  summit set  as the  objects of a category whose morphisms are the conjugations by simple elements, the centralizer is given by the endomorphisms of the given object.\n\nWe illustrate this on an example:\n\njulia> b=B(2,1,4,1,4)\n214.14\n\njulia> c=B(1,4,1,4,3)\n14.143\n\njulia> d=conjugating_elt(b,c)\n(1)⁻¹21321432\n\njulia> b^d\n14.143\n\njulia> centralizer_gens(b)\n3-element Vector{GarsideElt{Perm{Int16}, BraidMonoid{Perm{Int16}, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}}}:\n 321432.213243\n 21.1\n 4\n\njulia> C=conjcat(b;ss=:ss)\ncategory with 10 objects and 32 generating maps\n\njulia> C.obj\n10-element Vector{GarsideElt{Perm{Int16}, BraidMonoid{Perm{Int16}, FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}}}:\n 1214.4\n 214.14\n 124.24\n 1343.1\n 14.124\n 143.13\n 24.214\n 134.14\n 13.134\n 14.143\n\nThere   is  a   faster  solution   to  the   conjugacy  problem   given  in gebgon10:  for each b∈ M, they define a particular simple  left divisor of b, its preferred prefix such that the operation sliding  which  cyclically  conjugates  b  by  its preferred prefix, is eventually periodic, and the period is contained in the super summit set of x.  We say that x is in its sliding circuit if some iterated sliding of x is equal to x. The set of sliding circuits in a given conjugacy class is  smaller than the super  summit set, thus allows  to solve the conjugacy problem faster.

For each irreducible  group the character  table is either  computed using recursive formulas  for the infinite series,  or read into the  system from a library file  for the  exceptional types.  Thus, character  tables can  be obtained quickly  even for very large groups  (e.g., E₈). Similar remarks apply for conjugacy classes.\n\nThe  conjugacy  classes  and  irreducible  characters of irreducible finite complex reflection groups have canonical labelings by certain combinatorial objects;  these labelings are used in the  tables we give. For the classes, these  are partitions or partition tuples  for the infinite series, or, for exceptional  Coxeter  groups,  Carter's  admissible  diagrams Carter1972; for other  primitive  complex  reflection  groups  we  just  use  words  in the generators  to specify  the classes.

The valuation  and degree of these give  two  integers  b,B  for  each  irreducible  character  of  W (see charinfo(W).b  and  charinfo(W).B).  For  finite  Coxeter  groups,  the valuation  and degree of  the generic degrees  of the one-parameter generic Hecke  algebra  give  two  more  integers  a,A  (see  charinfo(W).a and charinfo(W).A,   and   Carter1985,   Ch.11. These will also be used in the operations of truncated inductions explained in the chapter \"Reflection subgroups\".\n\nIwahori-Hecke  algebras and  cyclotomic Hecke  algebras also have character tables, see the corresponding chapters.\n\nWe  now describe for each type our conventions for labeling the classes and characters.\n\nType  Aₙ (n≥0). In this  case we have  W ≅ 𝔖ₙ₊₁. The classes and characters  are labeled by partitions of n+1. The partition corresponding to  a class describes  the cycle type  for the elements  in that class; the representative   in  '.classtext'   is  the   concatenation  of  the  words corresponding  to each part, and to a part i is associated the product of i-1  consecutive generators (starting one  higher that the last generator used  for the previous  parts). The partition  corresponding to a character describes  the type of  the Young subgroup  such that the trivial character induced  from this  subgroup contains  that character with multiplicity 1 and such that every other character occurring in this induced character has a  higher a-value. Thus, the sign  character corresponds to the partition (1ⁿ⁺¹)  and  the  trivial  character  to  the  partition  (n+1). The character of the reflection representation of W is labeled by (n,1).\n\nType  Bₙ  (n≥2).  In  this  case  W=W(Bₙ) is isomorphic to the wreath product  of the cyclic  group of order  2 with the  symmetric group 𝔖ₙ. Hence  the classes and characters are  parameterized by pairs of partitions such  that the total sum of their  parts equals n. The pair corresponding to  a class describes the signed cycle type for the elements in that class, as in Carter1972. We use the convention that if (λ,μ) is such a pair then λ corresponds to the positive and μ to the negative cycles.  Thus, (1ⁿ,-) and (-,1ⁿ) label  the trivial class and the class containing  the longest element, respectively. The pair corresponding to an irreducible character is determined via Clifford theory, as follows.\n\nWe  have a semidirect product decomposition W(Bₙ)=N ⋊ 𝔖ₙ where N is the standard  n-dimensional  𝔽₂ⁿ-vector  space.  For  a,b  ≥  0 such that n=a+b let η_{a,b} be the irreducible character of N which takes value 1  on the first a standard basis vectors and value -1 on the next b standard  basis vectors of N. Then  the inertia subgroup of η_{a,b} has the  form T_{a,b}=N.(𝔖_a × 𝔖_b) and  we can extend η_{a,b} trivially to an  irreducible  character  η̃_{a,b}  of  T_{a,b}.  Let  α and β be partitions  of a and b, respectively. We take the tensor product of the corresponding  irreducible characters of 𝔖_a and 𝔖_b and regard this as an  irreducible  character  of  T_{a,b}.  Multiplying this character with η̃_{a,b}  and  inducing  to  W(Bₙ)  yields an irreducible character χ= χ_{(α,β)}  of W(Bₙ). This defines the correspondence between irreducible characters and pairs of partitions as above.\n\nFor example, the pair ((n),-) labels the trivial character and (-,(1ⁿ)) labels  the  sign  character.  The  character  of  the  natural  reflection representation is labeled by ((n-1),(1)).\n\nType  Dₙ (n≥4). In this case W=W(Dₙ) can be embedded as a subgroup of index  2 into the Coxeter  group W(Bₙ). The intersection  of a class of W(Bₙ) with W(Dₙ) is either empty or a single class in W(Dₙ) or splits up  into two classes in  W(Dₙ). This also leads  to a parameterization of the  classes of W(Dₙ) by pairs of  partitions (λ,μ) as before but where the  number of parts of μ is even and where there are two classes of this type  if μ is empty and all parts of  λ are even. In the latter case we denote  the two classes in W(Dₙ) by (λ,+) and (λ,-), where we use the convention  that  the  class  labeled  by (λ,+) contains a representative which  can be written  as a word  in {s₁,s₃,…,sₙ} and  (λ,-) contains a representative which can be written as a word in {s₂,s₃, …,sₙ}.\n\nBy  Clifford theory the restriction of  an irreducible character of W(Bₙ) to  W(Dₙ)  is  either  irreducible  or  splits  up  into  two irreducible components.  Let (α,β) be  a pair of  partitions with total  sum of parts equal to n. If α!=β then the restrictions of the irreducible characters of  W(Bₙ) labeled  by (α,β)  and (β,α)  are irreducible and equal. If α=β  then the restriction of the character labeled by (α,α) splits into two  irreducible components  which we  denote by  (α,+) and (α,-). Note that  this can only happen if n is  even. In order to fix the notation we use  a  result  of  Stembridge1989  which describes the value  of the  difference of  these two  characters on  a class of the form (λ,+)  in terms of the character values of the symmetric group 𝔖_{n/2}. Recall  that it is implicit  in the notation (λ,+)  that all parts of λ are even. Let λ' be the partition of n/2 obtained by dividing each part by  2. Then the value of χ_{(α,-)}-χ_{(α,+)} on an element in the class (λ,+) is given by 2^{k(λ)} times the value of the irreducible character of  𝔖_{n/2} labeled by α on the class of cycle type λ'. (Here, k(λ) denotes the number of non-zero parts of λ.)\n\nThe  labels for the trivial, the  sign and the natural reflection character are the same as for W(Bₙ), since these characters are restrictions of the corresponding characters of W(Bₙ).\n\nThe groups G(d,1,n). They  are isomorphic to the wreath product of the cyclic group of order d with  the  symmetric  group  𝔖ₙ.  Hence  the  classes  and characters are parameterized  by d-tuples of partitions such that the total sum of their parts  equals n. The words chosen  as representatives of the classes are, when d>2, computed in a slightly different way than for Bₙ, in order to agree  with the words on which Ram  and Halverson compute the characters of the  Hecke algebra. First the parts of the d partitions are merged in one big  partition and sorted in  increasing order. Then, to  a part i coming from  the j-th partition is  associated the word (l+1…1… l+1)ʲ⁻¹l+2…l+i where l is the highest generator used to express the previous part.\n\nThe  d-tuple corresponding to an  irreducible character is determined via Clifford  theory in  a similar  way than  for the  Bₙ case.  The identity character  has the first  partition with one  part equal n  and the other ones  empty. The character of the  reflection representations has the first two  partitions with one part  equal respectively to n-1  and to 1, and the other partitions empty.\n\nThe groups G(de,e,n). They  are normal  subgroups of  index e  in G(de,1,n).  The quotient is cyclic,  generated by the image g  of the first generator of G(de,1,n). The  classes are parameterized as the  classes of G(de,e,n) with an extra information for a component of a class which splits.\n\nAccording  to  Hugues1985,  a  class  C of G(de,1,n) parameterized  by a de-partition (S₀S_de-1) is in G(de,e,n) if e  divides ᵢ i _p Sᵢp. It  splits in d classes for the largest d  dividing e and all parts of all  Sᵢ and such that Sᵢ is empty if d  does not divide i. If w is in C then 'gⁱ w g⁻ⁱ' for 'i in 0:d-1' are  representatives of the classes of G(de,e,n) which meet C. They are described by appending the integer i to the label for C.\n\nThe  characters are described by Clifford theory. We make g act on labels for  characters of G(de,1,n)  . The action  of g permutes circularly by d  the partitions in the de-tuple.  A character has same restriction to G(de,e,n)  as its transform by g.  The number of irreducible components of its restriction is equal to the order k of its stabilizer under powers of  g.  We  encode  a  character  of  G(de,e,n)  by first, choosing the smallest  for lexicographical order label  of a character whose restriction contains  it; then this label is periodic with a motive repeated k times; we  represent the  character by  one of  these motives,  to which we append E(k)ⁱ for 'i in 0:k-1' to describe which component of the restriction we choose.\n\nTypes G₂ and F₄. The matrices of character values and the orderings and labelings  of  the  irreducible  characters  are  exactly  the  same  as in Carter1985,  p.412/413:  in  type  G₂  the  character φ₁,₃'  takes the value -1 on the reflection associated to the long simple root;  in type F₄, the characters φ₁,₁₂', φ₂,₄', φ₄,₇', φ₈,₉' and φ₉,₆' occur in the induced of the identity from the A₂ corresponding to the  short  simple  roots;  the  pairs  (φ₂,₁₆',  φ₂,₄″)  and (φ₈,₃', φ₈,₉″)  are  related  by  tensoring  by  sign; and finally φ₆,₆″ is the exterior  square of the  reflection representation. Note,  however, that we put  the long root at  the left of the  Dynkin diagrams to be in accordance with the conventions in Lusztig1985, (4.8) and (4.10).\n\nThe classes are labeled by Carter's admissible diagrams Carter1972.  A character  is labeled  by a pair (d,b) where  d denotes the  degree and b  the corresponding b-invariant. If there  are several characters with the same  pair (d,b) we attach a prime to them, as in Carter1985.\n\nTypes  E₆,E₇,E₈. The character  tables are obtained  by specialization of those  of the Hecke algebra. The classes are labeled by Carter's admissible diagrams Carter1972. A character is labeled by the pair (d,b)  where  d  denotes  the  degree  and  b  is  the  corresponding b-invariant.  For  these  types,  this  gives  a  unique  labeling of the characters.\n\nNon-crystallographic  types I₂(m), H₃, H₄. In these cases we do not have  canonical  labelings  for  the  classes.  We  label  them  by reduced expressions.\n\nEach  character for  type H₃  is uniquely  determined by the pair (d,b) where  d is the degree and  b the corresponding b-invariant. For type H₄  there are just  two characters (those  of degree 30)  for which the corresponding  pairs are  the same.  These two  characters are nevertheless distinguished  by  their  fake  degrees:  the  character φ₃₀,₁₀' has fake degree  q¹⁰+q¹²+ higher terms, while φ₃₀,₁₀″ has fake degree q¹⁰+q¹⁴+ higher  terms. The characters in the table for type H₄ are ordered in the same way as in Alvis and Lusztig1982.\n\nFinally,  the characters  of degree 2  for type  I₂(m) are  ordered as follows.  The matrix representations affording the characters of degree 2 are given by: ρ_j  s₁s₂  beginpmatrixE(m)^j00E(m)^-jendpmatrix  s₁beginpmatrix0110endpmatrix where  1 ≤ j ≤  ⌊(m-1)/2⌋. The reflection representation is  ρ₁. The  characters in  the table  are ordered by listing first the characters of degree 1 and then ρ₁,ρ₂,….\n\nPrimitive complex reflection groups G₄ to G₃₄. The  groups G₂₃=H₃, G₂₈=F₄, G₃₀=H₄ are exceptional Coxeter groups and have  been  explained  above.  Similarly  for  the  other groups labels for characters  consist primarily  of the  pair (d,b)  where d  denotes the degree  and b is the corresponding  b-invariant. This is sufficient for G₄,  G₁₂, G₂₂ and G₂₄. For other  groups there are pairs or triples of  characters which  have the  same (d,b)  value. We  disambiguate these according  to  the  conventions  of Malle2000 for G₂₇, G₂₉, G₃₁, G₃₃ and G₃₄:\n\nFor G₂₇:\n\nThe  fake degree  of φ₃,₅'  (resp. φ₃,₂₀',  φ₈,₉″) has smaller degree that  of  φ₃,₅″  (resp.  φ₃,₂₀″,  φ₈,₉'). The characters φ₅,₁₅' and φ₅,₆' occur with multiplicity 1 in the induced from the trivial character of  the parabolic subgroup  of type A₂  generated by the  first and third generator  (it is asserted mistakenly in Malle2000 that φ₅,₆″ does not occur in this induced; it occurs with multiplicity 2).\n\nFor G₂₉:\n\nThe  character  φ₆,₁₀‴  is  the  exterior  square  of φ₄,₁; its complex conjugate  is φ₆,₁₀⁗. The  character φ₁₅,₄″ occurs  in φ₄,₁⊗φ₄,₃; the character  φ₁₅,₁₂″  is  tensored  by  the  sign  character from φ₁₅,₄″. Finally  φ₆,₁₀' occurs in  the induced from  the trivial character of the standard parabolic subgroup of type A₃ generated by the first, second and fourth generators.\n\nFor G₃₁:\n\nThe  characters φ₁₅,₈', φ₁₅,₂₀' and φ₄₅,₈″ occur in φ₄,₁⊗φ₂₀,₇; the character   φ₂₀,₁₃'  is  complex  conjugate  of  φ₂₀,₇;  the  character φ₄₅,₁₂'  is tensored by sign of φ₄₅,₈'. The two terms of maximal degree of  the fakedegree of φ₃₀,₁₀' are  q⁵⁰+q⁴⁶ while for φ₃₀,₁₀″ they are q⁵⁰+2q⁴⁶.\n\nFor G₃₃:\n\nThe  terms of  maximal degree  of the  fakedegree of φ₁₀,₈' are q²⁸+q²⁶ while  for φ₁₀,₈' they are q²⁸+q²⁴. The  terms of maximal degree of the fakedegree   of  φ₄₀,₅'  are  q³¹+q²⁹   while  for  φ₄₀,₅″  they  are q³¹+2q²⁹.  The character  φ₁₀,₁₇' is  tensored by  sign of φ₁₀,₈' and φ₄₀,₁₄' is tensored by sign of φ₄₀,₅'.\n\nFor G₃₄:\n\nThe  character φ₂₀,₃₃' occurs in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₅,₁₄. The character φ₇₀,₉' is rational.  The character  φ₇₀,₉″ occurs  in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₅,₁₄.  The character φ₇₀,₄₅'   is  rational.The   character  φ₇₀,₄₅″   is  tensored  by  the determinant  character of  φ₇₀,₉″. The  character φ₅₆₀,₁₈' is rational. The character φ₅₆₀,₁₈‴ occurs in φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇. The character φ₂₈₀,₁₂' occurs    in   φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇.   The   character   φ₂₈₀,₃₀″   occurs   in φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇.  The  character  φ₅₄₀,₂₁'  occurs  in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₀₅,₂₀. The character  φ₁₀₅,₈' is  complex conjugate  of φ₁₀₅,₄,  and φ₈₄₀,₁₃' is complex  conjugate  of  φ₈₄₀,₁₁.  The  character  φ₈₄₀,₂₃'  is  complex conjugate  of  φ₈₄₀,₁₉.  Finally  φ₁₂₀,₂₁'  occurs  in induced from the trivial character of the standard parabolic subgroup of type A₅ generated by the generators of G₃₄ with the third one omitted.\n\nFor  the groups G₅ and G₇ we  adopt the following conventions. For G₅ they are compatible with those of MalleRouquier2003 and BroueMalleMichel2014.\n\nFor G₅:\n\nWe  let W=ComplexReflectionGroup(5),  so the  generators are  W(1) and W(2).\n\nThe  character φ₁,₄' (resp. φ₁,₁₂', φ₂,₃') takes the value 1 (resp. ζ₃,  -ζ₃)  on  W(1).  The  character  φ₁,₈″ is complex conjugate to φ₁,₁₆,  and the character  φ₁,₈' is complex  conjugate to φ₁,₄' . The character  φ₂,₅″ is complex  conjugate to φ₂,₁;  φ₂,₅' take the value -1 on W(1). The character φ₂,₇' is complex conjugate to φ₂,₅'.\n\nFor G₇:\n\nWe  let W=ComplexReflectionGroup(7),  so the  generators are W(1), W(2) and W(3).\n\nThe  characters  φ₁,₄'  and  φ₁,₁₀'  take  the value 1 on W(2). The character  φ₁,₈″ is complex  conjugate to φ₁,₁₆  and φ₁,₈' is complex conjugate  to φ₁,₄'. The characters φ₁,₁₂'  and φ₁,₁₈' take the value ζ₃  on W(2). The character φ₁,₁₄″ is complex conjugate to φ₁,₂₂ and φ₁,₁₄'  is complex conjugate to φ₁,₁₀'. The character φ₂,₃' takes the value  -ζ₃ on  W(2) and  φ₂,₁₃' takes  the value  -1 on W(2). The characters  φ₂,₁₁″, φ₂,₅″, φ₂,₇‴ and  φ₂,₁ are Galois conjugate, as well  as  the  characters  φ₂,₇',  φ₂,₁₃',  φ₂,₁₁'  and  φ₂,₅'. The character  φ₂,₉' is complex  conjugate to φ₂,₁₅  and φ₂,₉‴ is complex conjugate to φ₂,₃'.\n\nFinally,  for the remaining groups G₆, G₈  to G₁₁, G₁₃ to G₂₁, G₂₅, G₂₆,  G₃₂ and G₃₃ there are only  pairs of characters with same value (d,b).  We give labels uniformly to these characters by applying in order the following rules :\n\nIf the two characters have  different fake degrees, label φ_{d,b}' the  one  whose  fake  degree  is  minimal  for  the  lexicographic  order of  polynomials (starting with the highest term).\nFor the not yet labeled pairs, if only one of the two characters has the  property   that  in  its   Galois  orbit  at   least  one  character  is  distinguished by its (d,b)-invariant, label it φ_{d,b}'.\nFor the not yet labeled pairs,  if the minimum of the (d,b)-value (for  the  lexicographic  order  (d,b))  in  the  Galois  orbits  of the two  character  is different, label φ_{d,b}' the character with the minimal  minimum.\nWe define now a new invariant  for characters: consider all the pairs of  irreducible   characters  χ  and  ψ  uniquely  determined  by  their  (d,b)-invariant such that φ occurs with non-zero multiplicity m in  χ⊗ψ.  We define  t(φ) to  be the  minimal (for  lexicographic order)  possible list (d(χ),b(χ),d(ψ),b(ψ),m).\n\nFor  the not  yet labeled  pairs, if  the t-invariants are different, label φ_{d,b}' the character with the minimal t-invariant.\n\nAfter  applying  the  last  rule  all  the  pairs  will be labelled for the considered  groups. The labelling obtained  is compatible for G₂₅, G₂₆, G₃₂  and G₃₃  with that  of Malle2000  and for G₈ with that described in MalleRouquier2003.\n\nWe  should  emphasize  that  for  all  groups  with  a  few exceptions, the parameters  for characters do  not depend on  any non-canonical choice. The exceptions  are G(de,e,n) with e>1, and G₅, G₇, G₂₇, G₂₈, G₂₉ and  G₃₄, groups  which admit  outer automorphisms  preserving the set of reflections,  so choices  of a  particular value  on a particular generator must be made for characters which are not invariant by these automorphisms.\n\nLabels  for the classes. For the exceptional complex reflection groups, the labels  for the classes represent the  decomposition of a representative of the  class as a product of generators, with the additional conventions that 'z'  represents the generator  of the center  and for well-generated groups 'c'  represents a Coxeter element  (a product of the  generators which is a regular element for the highest reflection degree).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Gapjm.Chars.CharTable","page":"Gapjm Documentation","title":"Gapjm.Chars.CharTable","text":"CharTable is a structure to hold character tables of groups and Hecke  algebras\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Gapjm.Chars.on_chars","page":"Gapjm Documentation","title":"Gapjm.Chars.on_chars","text":"on_chars(G,aut)\n\naut  is an automorphism of  the group G (for  a permutation group, this could  be  given  as  a  permutation  normalizing  G).

Let 𝐓 be a maximal torus of 𝐆, let X(𝐓)  be the  character group  of 𝐓  (resp. Y(𝐓)  the dual lattice of one-parameter  subgroups  of  𝐓)  and  Φ  (resp  Φ^) the roots (resp. coroots) of 𝐆 with respect to 𝐓.\n\nThen  𝐆 is  determined up  to isomorphism  by the  root datum (X(𝐓),Φ, Y(𝐓),Φ^).  In algebraic terms, this consists  in giving a free ℤ-lattice X=X(𝐓) of dimension the rank of 𝐓 (which is also called the rank of 𝐆),  and a root system Φ ⊂ X,  and giving similarly the dual roots Φ^⊂ Y=Y(𝐓).\n\nThis  is obtained  by a  slight generalization  of our  setup for a Coxeter group  W. This time we assume the canonical basis of the vector space V on  which W acts is a ℤ-basis of  X, and Φ is specified by a matrix simpleroots(W)  whose lines are the simple  roots expressed in this basis of  X. Similarly Φ^  is described by  a matrix simplecoroots(W) whose lines  are the simple coroots in the basis  of Y dual to the chosen basis of  X. The duality pairing between X and Y is the canonical one, that is   the  pairing  between  vectors   x∈  X  and  y∈   Y  is  given  by transpose(x)*y. Thus, we must have the relation simpleroots(W)*transpose(simplecoroots(W))=cartan(W).\n\nWe  get that  by a  the function  rootdatum, whose  arguments are the two matrices simpleroots(W) and simplecoroots(W) described above. The roots need  not generate V, so  the matrices need not  be square. For instance, the root datum of the linear group of rank 3 can be specified as:\n\njulia> W=rootdatum([-1 1 0;0 -1 1],[-1 1 0;0 -1 1])\nA₂Φ₁\n\njulia> reflrep(W,W(1))\n3×3 Matrix{Int64}:\n 0  1  0\n 1  0  0\n 0  0  1\n\nhere  the symmetric group on 3 letters  acts by permutation of the basis of X.  The dimension of X (size(simpleroots(W),2)) is the rank and the dimension of the subspace generated by the roots (size(simpleroots(W),1)) is  called the  semi-simple rank.  In the  example the  rank is 3 and the semisimple rank is 2.\n\nThe  default form  W=coxgroup(:A,2) defines  the adjoint  algebraic group (the  group with a trivial center). In that  case Φ is a basis of X, so simpleroots(W)  is  the  identity  matrix  and  simplecoroots(W) is the Cartan  matrix cartan(W) of the root system. \n\nThe   form  coxgroup(:A,2,sc=true)   constructs  the   semisimple  simply connected  algebraic  group,  where  simpleroots(W)  is the transposed of cartan(W) and simplecoroots(W) is the identity matrix.\n\nThere  is an extreme form  of root data which  requires another function to specify:  when W is the trivial coxgroup()  and there are thus no roots (in  this case 𝐆 is a torus), the root datum cannot be determined by the roots,  but is entirely determined by the rank r. The function torus(r) constructs such a root datum.\n\nFinally,  the function rootdatum also understands some familiar names for the algebraic groups and gives the results that could be obtained by giving the appropriate matrices simpleroots(W) and simplecoroots(W):\n\njulia> rootdatum(:gl,3)   # same as the previous example\ngl₃\n\nSemisimple elements\n\nIt  is also possible  to compute with  semi-simple elements.

These  are  represented  as  a vector of Rationals r such that 0≤r<1, or, more to the point, a Vector{Root1}. The  function  SS  constructs  a  semisimple  element  from  a  vector of Rational,  while  the  more  general  function  can  construct semisimple elements from arbitrary ring elements (like elements of K, Mvps,…\n\njulia> G=rootdatum(:sl,4)\nsl₄\n\njulia> L=reflection_subgroup(G,[1,3])\nA₃₍₁₃₎=A₁×A₁Φ₁\n\njulia> C=algebraic_centre(L)\n(Z0 = SubTorus(A₃₍₁₃₎=A₁×A₁Φ₁,[1 2 1]), AZ = SSGroup([<1,1,-1>]), descAZ = [[1, 2]], ZD = SSGroup([<-1,1,1>,<1,1,-1>]))\n\njulia> T=torsion_subgroup(C.Z0,3)\nSSGroup([<ζ₃,ζ₃²,ζ₃>])\n\njulia> e=sort(elements(T))\n3-element Vector{SemisimpleElement{Root1}}:\n <1,1,1>\n <ζ₃,ζ₃²,ζ₃>\n <ζ₃²,ζ₃,ζ₃²>\n\nFirst,  the  group  𝐆  =SL₄  is  constructed,  then the Levi subgroup L consisting   of  block-diagonal  matrices  of  shape  2×2.

We say that F₀∈ GL(V)  is an  automorphism of  R if  it permutes  R and is of finite order  (finite  order  is  automatic  if  R generates V). It follows by chap.  VI,  §1.1,  lemme  1  Bourbaki1968 that the dual F₀*∈  GL(V*)  permutes  the  coroots  R*⊂  V*; thus F₀ normalizes the reflection  group  W  associated  to  R,  that  is  w↦  F₀wF₀⁻¹ is an automorphism  of W. Thus we get a reflection coset WF₀, which we call a Coxeter coset.\n\nThe  motivation for introducing Coxeter  cosets comes from automorphisms of algebraic  reductive groups, giving rise to non-split reductive groups over finite fields. Let 𝐆 be a connected reductive algebraic group 𝐆 over an algebraic  closure 𝔽̄_q of a finite field 𝔽_q, defined over 𝔽_q; this corresponds  to a  Frobenius endomorphism  F so  that the finite group of rational  points 𝐆(𝔽_q) identifies to the  subgroup 𝐆^F of fixed points under F.\n\nLet 𝐓 be a maximal torus of 𝐆, and Φ (resp. Φ*) be the roots (resp. coroots)  of 𝐆 with respect  to 𝐓 in the  character group X(𝐓) (resp. the  group of one-parameter subgroups Y(𝐓)). Then 𝐆 is determined up to isomorphism  by (X(𝐓),Φ,Y(𝐓),Φ*); this corresponds  to give a root system in   the  vector  space  V=ℚ ⊗ X(𝐓)   and  a  rational  reflection  group W=N_𝐆(𝐓)/𝐓 acting on it.\n\nIf  𝐓 is F-stable the Frobenius endomorphism F acts also naturally on X(T)  and defines thus  an endomorphism of  V, which is  of the form q F₀, where F₀∈ GL(V) is of finite order and normalizes W. We get thus a Coxeter  coset WF₀⊂GL(V).  The data  (X(𝐓), Φ,  Y(𝐓), Φ*,  F₀), and the integer   q  completely  determine  up   to  isomorphism  the  associated reductive finite group 𝐆^F. Thus these data is a way of representing in the  essential  information  which  determines  a  finite  reductive group. Indeed, all properties of Chevalley groups can be computed from that datum: symbols  representing characters, conjugacy classes,  and finally the whole character table of 𝐆^F.\n\nIt  turns out that  many interesting objects  attached to this datum depend only on (V,W, F₀): the order of the maximal tori, the fake degrees, the order  of 𝐆^F, symbols representing unipotent characters, Deligne-Lusztig induction  in  terms  of  almost  characters, the Fourier matrix relating characters and almost characters, etc… (see, e.g., Broue-Malle-Michel1993).  It is thus possible to extend their  construction to non-crystallographic groups (or even to more general complex  reflection groups, see \"Spets\"); this is  why we did not include a root  system in  the definition  of a  reflection coset. However, unipotent conjugacy classes for instance depend on the root system.\n\nWe assume now that 𝐓 is contained in an F-stable Borel subgroup of 𝐆. This  defines an order  on the roots,  and there is  a unique element ϕ∈ W F₀,  the  reduced  element  of  the  coset,  which  preserves the set of positive  roots.  It  thus  defines  a  diagram  automorphism, that is an automorphism  of the Coxeter system (W,S).  This element is stored in the component  '.phi' of the coset record. It may be defined without mentioning the  roots,  as  follows:  (W,F₀(S))  is  another  Coxeter  system,  thus conjugate to S by a unique element of W, thus there is a unique element ϕ∈  WF₀ which stabilizes S (a proof  follows from Theoreme 1, chap. V, §3  Bourbaki1968). We  consider thus  cosets of the form Wϕ where ϕ stabilizes S. The coset W ϕ is completely defined by the permutation  '.phi'  when  𝐆  is  semi-simple  –-  equivalently when Φ generates  V; in this  case we just  need to specify  'phi' to define the coset.\n\nThere is a slight generalisation of the above setup, covering in particular the  case of the Ree  and Suzuki groups. We  consider 𝐆^F where F not a Frobenius  endomorphism, but  an isogeny  such that  some power  F^n is a Frobenius endomorphism. Then F still defines an endomorphism of V which normalizes  W; we define a real number q such that F^n is attached to an  𝔽_{qⁿ}-structure. Then we still have F=q F₀ where F₀ is of finite order  but q is no more an integer.  Thus F₀∈ GL(V⊗ ℝ) but F₀∉ GL(V). For  instance, for the  Ree and Suzuki  groups, F₀ is  an automorphism of order  2 of W, which is of type G₂, B₂ or F₄, and q=√2 for B₂ and  F₄ and q=√3  for G₂ This  can be constructed  starting from root systems  for G₂, B₂ or  F₄ where all the  roots have the same length. This kind of root system is not crystallographic. Such non-crystallographic  root systems exist for all finite Coxeter groups such as  the dihedral groups, H₃ and H₄. We will call here Weyl cosets the cosets  corresponding to rational forms  of algebraic groups, which include thus some non-rational roots systems for B₂, G₂ and F₄.\n\nSpets\n\nWe  now extend the above notions  to general complex reflection groups. Let W⊂  GL(V) be a complex reflection group  on the vector space V. Let ϕ be  an element  of GL(V)  which normalizes  W. Then  the coset  Wϕ is called a reflection coset.\n\nA reference for these cosets is Broue-Malle-Michel 1999 When W is a so-called Spetsial group, they are the basic object for the construction  of  a  Spetses,  which  is  an object attached to a complex reflection  group from which one can derive combinatorially some attributes shared with finite reductive groups, like unipotent degrees, etc….\n\nWe  say that  a reflection  coset is  irreducible if  W is irreducible. A general  coset is a direct  product of descents of  scalars, which is the case  where ϕ  is transitive  on the  irreducible components  of W. The irreducible    cosets   have   been   classified   in   Broue-Malle-Michel 1999:  up to multiplication of ϕ by a scalar, there is usually only one or two possible cosets for a given irreducible group.\n\nWe  deal only  with finite  order cosets,  that is,  we assume there is a (minimal) integer δ such that (Wϕ)^δ=W. Then the group generated by W and ϕ is finite, of order δ|W|.\n\nA  subset C  of a  Wϕ is  called a  conjugacy class  if one of the following equivalent conditions is fulfilled:\n\nC is the orbit of an element in Wϕ under the conjugation action of W.\nC is a conjugacy class of ⟨W,ϕ⟩ contained in Wϕ.\nThe set {w∈ W|wϕ∈ C} is  a ϕ-conjugacy  class of W (two elements\n\nv,w∈  W are called ϕ-conjugate, if and only if there exists x∈ W with v=xwϕ(x⁻¹)).\n\nAn irreducible character of ⟨W,ϕ⟩ has some non-zero values on Wϕ if and only if its restriction to W is irreducible. Further, two characters χ₁ and  χ₂  which  have  same  irreducible  restriction  to  W differ by a character  of  the  cyclic  group  ⟨ϕ⟩  (which identifies to the quotient ⟨W,ϕ⟩/W). A set containing one extension to ⟨W,ϕ⟩ of each ϕ-invariant character  of W is called a set  of irreducible characters of Wϕ. Two such  characters  are  orthogonal  for  the  scalar  product  on  the class functions on Wϕ given by χψ=W¹_w Wχ(wϕ)overlineψ(wϕ) For rational groups (Weyl groups), Lusztig has defined a choice of a set of irreducible  characters for  Wϕ (called  the preferred extensions), but for  more  general  reflection  cosets  we  have made some rather arbitrary choices,  which  however  have  the  property  that their values lie in the smallest possible field.\n\nThe  character  table  of  Wϕ  is  the  table  of  values  of  a set of irreducible characters on the conjugacy classes.\n\nA subcoset Lwϕ of Wϕ is given by a reflection subgroup L of W and an element w of W such that wϕ normalizes L.\n\nWe  then have a natural notion of  restriction of class functions on Wϕ to  class  functions  on  Lwϕ  as  well  as  of  induction in the other direction.  These  maps  are  adjoint  with  respect  to the scalar product defined above (see Broue-Malle-Michel 1999).\n\nIn  this package the most general construction  of a reflection coset is by starting  from a reflection datum, and giving in addition the matrix 'F' of the  map ϕ:V→ V  (see the command  'spets'). However, at present, general cosets are only implemented for groups represented as permutation groups on a  set of roots, and  it is required that  the automorphism given preserves this  set up to  a scalar (it  is allowed that  these scalars depend on the pair  of an  irreducible component  and its  image). It  is also allowed to specify  ϕ by the permutation it induces on the roots; in this case it is assumed  that ϕ acts  trivially on the  orthogonal of the  roots, but the roots  could be those of a parent group, generating a larger space. Thus in any  case we have  a permutation representation  of ⟨W,ϕ⟩ and we consider the coset to be a set of permutations.\n\nReflection  cosets  are  implemented  in  by  a  struct which points to a reflection  group  record  and  has  additional  fields holding 'F' and the corresponding  permutation 'phi'. In the general case, on each component of W  which is  a descent  of scalars,  'F' will  permute the components and differ  by a scalar on each  component from an automorphism which preserves the  roots. In this case, we have  a permutation 'phi' and a 'scalar' which is stored for that component.\n\nThe  most common situation where cosets  with non-trivial 'phi' arise is as sub-cosets  of reflection groups. Here is an \"exotic\" example, see the next chapter for more classical examples involving Coxeter groups.\n\njulia> W=ComplexReflectionGroup(14)\nG₁₄\n\njulia> R=reflection_subgroup(W,[2,4])\nG₁₄₍₂₄₎=G₅\n\njulia> RF=spets(R,W(1)) # should be ²G₅(√6)\nG₁₄₍₂₄₎=²G₅\n\njulia> Diagram(RF)\nϕ acts as (1,2) on the component below\nG5 1(3)==2(3)\n\njulia> degrees(RF)\n2-element Vector{Tuple{Int64, Cyc}}:\n (6, 1)\n (12, -1)\n\nThe  last line shows for each  reflection degree the corresponding factor of  the coset, which is  the scalar by which  ϕ acts on the corresponding fundamental reflection invariant.

For  irreducible  characters of Weyl cosets,  we choose (following Lusztig) for each ϕ-stable character of W a  particular extension to a character of  W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩, which we will call the preferred extension. The character table of the coset Wϕ is the table of  the restrictions to  Wϕ of the  preferred extensions. The question of finding the conjugacy classes and character table of a Coxeter coset can be reduced to the case of irreducible root systems R.\n\nThe automorphism ϕ permutes the irreducible components of W, and Wϕ  is a direct  product of cosets  where ϕ permutes cyclically the irreducible components of W. The preferred extension is defined to be the  direct  product  of  the  preferred  extension  in  each  of these situations.\nAssume now that Wϕ is a descent of scalars, that is the decomposition in irreducible components W=W₁× ⋯ × Wₖ is cyclically permuted by ϕ. Then there are natural bijections from the ϕ-conjugacy classes of W to  the ϕᵏ-conjugacy classes  of W₁ as  well as from the ϕ-stable characters  of W to the ϕᵏ-stable  characters of W₁, which reduce the  definition of preferred  extensions on Wϕ  to the definition for W₁ϕᵏ.\nAssume now  that W  is the  Coxeter group  of an  irreducible root system.   ϕ  permutes  the  simple   roots,  hence  induces  a  graph automorphism  on  the  corresponding  Dynkin  diagram.  If  ϕ=1  then conjugacy  classes and  characters coincide  with those  of the Coxeter group W.\n\nThe  nontrivial cases for crystallographic roots  systems are (the order of ϕ  is written as left exponent to  the type): ²Aₙ, ²Dₙ, ³D₄, ²E₆. For  non-crystallographic root  systems where  all the  roots have the same length the additional cases ²B₂, ²G₂, ²F₄ and ²I₂(k) arise.\n\nIn  case  ³D₄  the  group  W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩  can be embedded into the Coxeter  group of type F₄, which induces a labeling for the conjugacy classes of the coset. The preferred extension is chosen as the (single) extension with rational values.\nIn case  ²Dₙ the  group W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩  is isomorphic  to a Coxeter group of type Bₙ. This induces a canonical labeling for the conjugacy classes  of the coset and allows to define the preferred extension in a combinatorial  way  using  the  labels  (pairs  of  partitions) for the characters of the Coxeter group of type Bₙ.\nIn the remaining crystallographic cases ϕ identifies to -w₀ where w₀  is the longest element of W.  So, there is a canonical labeling of  the conjugacy classes and characters of  the coset by those of W. The  preferred extensions  are defined  by describing  the signs of the character values on -w₀.\n\nThe  most general  construction of  a Coxeter  coset is  by starting from a Coxeter   datum   specified   by   the   matrices   of   'simpleRoots'  and 'simplecoroots',  and  giving  in  addition  the  matrix 'F0Mat' of the map F₀:V→ V (see the commands  'CoxeterCoset' and 'CoxeterSubCoset'). As for Coxeter  groups,  the  elements  of  Wϕ  are  uniquely  determined by the permutation  they  induce  on  the  set  of  roots  R.  We consider these permutations as 'elements' of the Coxeter coset.\n\nCoxeter  cosets are implemented by a struct which points to a Coxeter datum record  and  has  additional  fields  holding 'F0Mat' and the corresponding element  'phi'. Functions on the coset (for example, 'classinfo') are about properties  of  the  group  coset  W  ϕ  ;  however, most definitions for elements of untwisted Coxeter groups apply without change to elements in W ϕ:  e.g., if we define the length of  an element wϕ∈ Wϕ as the number of positive  roots it sends to negative ones, it  is the same as the length of w,  i.e., ϕ is of length 0, since ϕ has been chosen to preserve the set of positive roots. Similarly, the 'Coxeter word' describing wϕ is the same as the one for w, etc…\n\nWe associate to a Coxeter coset Wϕ a twisted Dynkin diagram, consisting of  the Dynkin diagram of W and  the graph automorphism induced by ϕ on this  diagram (this specifies the  group W⋊ ⟨F⟩, mentioned above, up to  isomorphism).

This variety  has a natural action of 𝐆 ^F on the left, so the corresponding Deligne-Lusztig  virtual module  ᵢ (-1)ⁱ  Hⁱ_c(X_𝐁ℚ _ℓ)  also. The character  of this virtual module  is the Deligne-Lusztig character R_𝐓 ^𝐆  (1); the  notation reflects  the fact  that one  can prove  that this character does not depend on the choice of 𝐁. Actually, this character is parameterized by an F-conjugacy class of W: if 𝐓₀⊂𝐁₀ is an F-stable pair,  there  is  an  unique  w  W=N_𝐆  (𝐓₀)𝐓₀  such  that the triple (𝐓,𝐁,F) is 𝐆-conjugate to (𝐓₀,𝐁₀,wF). In this case we denote R_w for R_𝐓^𝐆 (1); it depends only on the F-class of w.\n\nThe  unipotent characters of 𝐆 ^F are the irreducible constituents of the  R_w. In a  similar way that  the unipotent classes  are a building block  for  describing  the  conjugacy  classes  of  a reductive group, the unipotent characters are a building block for the irreducible characters of a  reductive group.  They can  be parameterized  by combinatorial data that Lusztig  has attached just to the coset Wφ, where φ is the finite order automorphism  of  X(𝐓₀)  such  that  F=qφ.  Thus, from the viewpoint of Chevie, they are objects combinatorially attached to a Coxeter coset.\n\nA  subset  of  the  unipotent  characters, the principal series unipotent characters,   can  be  described  in  an   elementary  way.  They  are  the constituents  of R₁, or equivalently the characters of the virtual module defined  by the  cohomology of  X_𝐁 ₀,  which is the discrete variety (𝐆  𝐁₀)^F; the virtual module reduces  to the actual module ℚ _ℓ(𝐆 𝐁₀)  ^F. Thus the  Deligne-Lusztig induction R_𝐓₀^𝐆 (1) reduces to Harish-Chandra  induction,  defined  as  follows:  let  𝐏  =𝐔  ⋊ 𝐋 be an F-stable  Levi decomposition of an F-stable parabolic subgroup of 𝐆. Then  the Harish-Chandra induced R_𝐋^𝐆 of a character χ of 𝐋^F is  the character Ind_𝐏^F^𝐆 ^Fχ, where χ̃ is the lift to 𝐏^F of  χ via  the quotient  𝐏^F𝐔 ^F=𝐋^F;  Harish-Chandra induction is a particular  case of Lusztig  induction, which is  defined when 𝐏 is not F-stable  using the variety X_𝐔 = g𝐔 𝐆 𝐔  g𝐔  F(g𝐔 ), and gives  for  an  𝐋^F-module  a  virtual  𝐆  ^F-module. Like ordinary induction,  these functors have adjoint functors going from representations of  𝐆 ^F to representations  (resp. virtual representations) of 𝐋^F called Harish-Chandra restriction (resp. Lusztig restriction).\n\nThe  commuting algebra  of 𝐆^F-endomorphisms  of R_𝐓₀^𝐆(1)  is an Iwahori-Hecke algebra for W^φ, with parameters which are some powers of q;  they  are  all  equal  to  q  when W^φ=W. Thus principal series unipotent characters correspond to characters of W^φ.\n\nTo  understand the  decomposition of  Deligne-Lusztig characters,  and thus unipotent  characters,  is  is  useful  to  introduce  another set of class functions  which are parameterized  by irreducible characters  of the coset Wφ.  If  χ  is  such  a  character,  we  define  the associated almost character  by: Rᵪ=W¹_w  Wχ(wφ) R_w.  The reason  to the name is that these class function are close to irreducible characters: they satisfy Rᵪ  R_ψ_𝐆^F=δ_χψ;  for  the  linear  and unitary group they are actually  unipotent characters (up to sign in the latter case). They are in general  sum (with  rational coefficients)  of a  small number of unipotent characters  in  the  same  Lusztig  family  (see  \"Families  of unipotent characters\").  The degree of Rᵪ is a  polynomial in q equal to the fake degree  of  the  character  χ  of  Wφ  (see  \"Functions  for Reflection cosets\").\n\nWe  now describe the parameterization of unipotent characters when W^φ=W, thus  when the coset Wφ identifies with W (the situation is similar but a  bit more difficult to describe  in general). The (rectangular) matrix of scalar  products ρ Rᵪ_𝐆  ^F, when characters  of W and unipotent characters  are arranged in the right  order, is block-diagonal with rather small blocks which are called Lusztig families.\n\nFor  the characters of W a family 𝓕 corresponds to a block of the Hecke algebra  over a ring called the Rouquier  ring. To 𝓕 Lusztig associates a small group Γ (not bigger than (ℤ/2)ⁿ, or 𝔖ᵢ for i≤5) such that the unipotent  characters in the family are  parameterized by the pairs (x,θ) taken  up to Γ-conjugacy, where x∈Γ and θ is an irreducible character of C_Γ(x). Further, the elements of 𝓕 themselves are parameterized by a  subset of such pairs,  and Lusztig defines a  pairing between such pairs which  computes the scalar product ρ  Rᵪ_𝐆^F. For more details see \"DrinfeldDouble\".\n\nA  second parameterization  of unipotent  character is  via Harish-Chandra series.  A character is called cuspidal if all its proper Harish-Chandra restrictions  vanish. There are few  cuspidal unipotent characters (none in linear   groups,  and  at   most  one  in   other  classical  groups).  The 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra of an Harish-Chandra induced R_𝐋^F^𝐆^Fλ,  where λ is a  cuspidal unipotent character turns out to be a Hecke algebra associated to the group W_𝐆^F(𝐋^F)=N_𝐆^F(𝐋)𝐋, which turns out to be a Coxeter group. Thus another  parameterization is by triples (𝐋,λ,φ),  where λ is a cuspidal unipotent  character of 𝐋^F and φ  is an irreducible character of the relative  group W_𝐆^F(𝐋^F). Such  characters are said  to belong to the Harish-Chandra series determined by (𝐋,λ).\n\nA  final  piece  of  information  attached  to  unipotent characters is the eigenvalues  of Frobenius. Let Fᵟ be  the smallest power of the isogeny F  which is a split Frobenius (that  is, Fᵟ is a Frobenius and φᵟ=1). Then  Fᵟ  acts  naturally  on  Deligne-Lusztig  varieties and thus on the corresponding  virtual modules, and commutes to the action of 𝐆^F; thus for  a given  unipotent character  ρ, a  submodule of  the virtual module which  affords  ρ  affords  a  single  eigenvalue μ of Fᵟ. Results of Lusztig  and Digne-Michel show that this  eigenvalue is of the form qᵃᵟλᵨ where  2a∈ℤ and λᵨ is a root of unity which depends only on ρ and not the  considered module.  This λᵨ  is called  the eigenvalue  of Frobenius attached  to ρ.  Unipotent characters  in the  Harish-Chandra series of a pair (𝐋,λ) have the same eigenvalue of Frobenius as λ.\n\nChevie   contains  tables  of  all   this  information,   and  can  compute Harish-Chandra  and Lusztig  induction of  unipotent characters  and almost characters. We illustrate the information on some examples:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)\nG₂\n\njulia> uc=UnipotentCharacters(W)\nUnipotentCharacters(G₂)\n      γ│   Deg(γ)  Feg Fr(γ)    label\n───────┼──────────────────────────────\nφ₁‚₀   │        1    1     1         \nφ₁‚₆   │       q⁶   q⁶     1         \nφ′₁‚₃  │  qΦ₃Φ₆/3   q³     1    (1,ρ)\nφ″₁‚₃  │  qΦ₃Φ₆/3   q³     1   (g₃,1)\nφ₂‚₁   │ qΦ₂²Φ₃/6  qΦ₈     1    (1,1)\nφ₂‚₂   │ qΦ₂²Φ₆/2 q²Φ₄     1   (g₂,1)\nG₂[-1] │ qΦ₁²Φ₃/2    0    -1   (g₂,ε)\nG₂[1]  │ qΦ₁²Φ₆/6    0     1    (1,ε)\nG₂[ζ₃] │qΦ₁²Φ₂²/3    0    ζ₃  (g₃,ζ₃)\nG₂[ζ₃²]│qΦ₁²Φ₂²/3    0   ζ₃² (g₃,ζ₃²)\n\nThe first column gives the name of the unipotent character; the first 6 are in  the  principal  series  so  are  named  according  to the corresponding characters  of W. The last 4 are cuspidal, and named by the corresponding eigenvalue  of  Frobenius,  which  is  displayed  in  the fourth column. In general   the   names   of   the   unipotent  characters  come  from  their parameterization  by  Harish-Chandra  series;  in  addition,  for classical groups, they are associated to symbols.\n\nThe first two characters are each in a family by themselves. The last eight are  in a family associated to the  group Γ=𝔖₃: the last column shows the parameters  (x,θ). The  second column  shows the  degree of the unipotent characters, which is transformed by the Lusztig Fourier matrix of the third column,  which gives the  degree of the  corresponding almost character, or equivalently the fake degree of the corresponding character of W.\n\nOne  can get  more information  on the  Lusztig Fourier  matrix of  the big family by asking\n\njulia> uc.families[1]\nFamily(D(𝔖 ₃),[5, 6, 4, 3, 8, 7, 9, 10])\nDrinfeld double of 𝔖 ₃, Lusztig′s version\n   label│eigen                                       \n────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────\n(1,1)   │    1 1/6  1/2  1/3  1/3  1/6  1/2  1/3  1/3\n(g₂,1)  │    1 1/2  1/2    0    0 -1/2 -1/2    0    0\n(g₃,1)  │    1 1/3    0  2/3 -1/3  1/3    0 -1/3 -1/3\n(1,ρ)   │    1 1/3    0 -1/3  2/3  1/3    0 -1/3 -1/3\n(1,ε)   │    1 1/6 -1/2  1/3  1/3  1/6 -1/2  1/3  1/3\n(g₂,ε)  │   -1 1/2 -1/2    0    0 -1/2  1/2    0    0\n(g₃,ζ₃) │   ζ₃ 1/3    0 -1/3 -1/3  1/3    0  2/3 -1/3\n(g₃,ζ₃²)│  ζ₃² 1/3    0 -1/3 -1/3  1/3    0 -1/3  2/3\n\nOne  can  do  computations  with  individual  unipotent characters.

We do not explain the details of this construction, but explain how its final result building Lusztig's Fourier matrix, and a variant of it that we use in Spetses, from Γ.\n\nThe  elements of the family are in bijection  with the set 𝓜 (Γ) of pairs (x,χ)  taken up to  Γ-conjugacy, where x∈Γ  and χ is an irreducible complex-valued   character  of  C_Γ(x).  To  such  a  pair  ρ=(x,χ)  is associated  an  eigenvalue  of  Frobenius  defined  by  ω_ρ=χ(x)χ(1). Lusztig  then defines a Fourier matrix S₀ whose coefficient is given, for ρ=(x,χ) and ρ'=(x', χ'), by:\n\nS₀_ρρ=C_Γ(x)¹_ρ₁=(x₁χ₁)χ₁(x)χ(y₁)\n\nwhere  the sum is over all pairs ρ₁∈𝓜 (Γ) which are Γ-conjugate to ρ' and  such that y₁ C_Γ(x). This  coefficient also represents the scalar product ρρ_𝐆^F of the corresponding unipotent characters.\n\nA  way to  understand the  formula for  S₀_ρρ better is to consider another  basis of the complex  vector space with basis  𝓜 (Γ), indexed by the  pairs  (x,y)  taken  up  to  Γ-conjugacy,  where  x  and y are commuting  elements  of  Γ.  This  basis  is  called  the basis of Mellin transforms, and given by:\n\n(xy)=_χ Irr(C_Γ(x))χ(y)(xχ)\n\nIn  the  basis  of  Mellin  transforms,  the  linear  map  S₀ is given by (x,y)↦(x⁻¹,y⁻¹)  and  the  linear  transformation  T which sends ρ to ω_ρρ   becomes  (x,y)↦(x,xy).   These  are   particular  cases  of  the permutation  representation of GL₂(ℤ)  on the basis  of Mellin transforms where beginpmatrixabcr cdendpmatrix acts by (x,y)↦(xᵃyᵇ,xᶜyᵈ).\n\nFourier  matrices in finite reductive groups  are given by the above matrix S₀.  But for non-rational Spetses, we use a different matrix S which in the  basis of Mellin transforms  is given by (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x). Equivalently, the formula S_ρρ differs from the formula for S₀_ρρ in that there  is no complex conjugation  of χ₁; thus the  matrix S is equal to S₀ multiplied on the right by the permutation matrix which corresponds to (x,χ)↦(x,χ̄).  The advantage of the matrix S over S₀ is that the pair S,T  satisfies directly the axioms for a fusion algebra (see below); also the matrix S is symmetric, while S₀ is Hermitian.\n\nThus there are two variants of 'drinfeld_double`:\n\ndrinfeld_double(g,lu=true)\n\nreturns  a family  containing Lusztig's  Fourier matrix  S₀, and an extra field  '.perm'  containing  the  permutation  of  the  indices  induced  by (x,χ)↦(x,χ̄),  which allows  to recover  S, as  well as  an extra field `:lusztig', set to 'true'.\n\ndrinfeld_double(g)\n\nreturns a family with the matrix S, which does not have fields '.lusztig' or '.perm'.\n\nThe family record 'f' returned also has the fields:\n\n:group: the group Γ.\n\n:charLabels: a list of labels describing the pairs (x,χ), and thus also specifying in which order they are taken.\n\n:fourierMat: the Fourier matrix (the matrix S or S₀ depending on the call).\n\n:eigenvalues: the eigenvalues of Frobenius.\n\n:xy: a list of pairs '[x,y]' which are representatives of the Γ-orbits of pairs of commuting elements.\n\n:mellinLabels: a list of labels describing the pairs '[x,y]'.\n\n:mellin:  the base change matrix between  the basis (x,χ) and the basis of   Mellin  transforms,   so  that   |f.fourierMat^(f.mellin^-1)|  is  the permutation  matrix (for (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x)  or (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x⁻¹) depending on the call).\n\n:special: the index of the special element, which is (x,χ)=(1,1).\n\njulia> drinfeld_double(CoxSym(3))\nFamily(D(CoxSym(3)):8)\n   label│eigen                                       \n────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────\n(1,X.1) │    1  1/6  1/3 1/6 -3/2 -3/2  1/3  1/3  1/3\n(1,X.2) │    1  1/3  2/3 1/3    0    0 -1/3 -1/3 -1/3\n(1,1)   │    1  1/6  1/3 1/6  3/2  3/2  1/3  1/3  1/3\n(2a,X.1)│   -1 -1/6    0 1/6  1/2 -1/2    0    0    0\n(2a,1)  │    1 -1/6    0 1/6 -1/2  1/2    0    0    0\n(3a,1)  │    1  1/3 -1/3 1/3    0    0  2/3 -1/3 -1/3\n(3a,X.2)│  ζ₃²  1/3 -1/3 1/3    0    0 -1/3 -1/3  2/3\n(3a,X.3)│   ζ₃  1/3 -1/3 1/3    0    0 -1/3  2/3 -1/3\n\njulia> drinfeld_double(CoxSym(3);lu=true)\nFamily(LD(CoxSym(3)):8)\n   label│eigen                                       \n────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────\n(1,X.1) │    1  1/6  1/3 1/6 -3/2 -3/2  1/3  1/3  1/3\n(1,X.2) │    1  1/3  2/3 1/3    0    0 -1/3 -1/3 -1/3\n(1,1)   │    1  1/6  1/3 1/6  3/2  3/2  1/3  1/3  1/3\n(2a,X.1)│   -1 -1/6    0 1/6  1/2 -1/2    0    0    0\n(2a,1)  │    1 -1/6    0 1/6 -1/2  1/2    0    0    0\n(3a,1)  │    1  1/3 -1/3 1/3    0    0  2/3 -1/3 -1/3\n(3a,X.2)│  ζ₃²  1/3 -1/3 1/3    0    0 -1/3  2/3 -1/3\n(3a,X.3)│   ζ₃  1/3 -1/3 1/3    0    0 -1/3 -1/3  2/3\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Gapjm.Families.ndrinfeld_double","page":"Gapjm Documentation","title":"Gapjm.Families.ndrinfeld_double","text":"ndrinfeld_double(g)\n\nThis  function returns the number of elements that the family associated to the  Drinfeld double of the group g would have, without computing it.

The function |Series| allows to explore a d-Harish-Chandra series.\n\njulia> W=rootdatum(\"3D4\")\n³D₄\n\njulia> l=cuspidal_data(W,3)\n2-element Vector{NamedTuple{(:levi, :cuspidal, :d), Tuple{Spets{FiniteCoxeterSubGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}, Int64, Root1}}}:\n (levi = ³D₄, cuspidal = 8, d = ζ₃)\n (levi = ³D₄₍₎=Φ₃², cuspidal = 1, d = ζ₃)\n\njulia> Series(W,l[2]...)\nζ₃-series R^³D₄_{³D₄₍₎=Φ₃²}(λ==Id)  H_G(L,λ)==hecke(G₄,Vector{Mvp{Cyc{Int64}, Int64}}[[ζ₃q², ζ₃, ζ₃q]])\n │    γᵩ    φ  ε family #\n─┼────────────────────────\n1│  φ₁‚₀ φ₁‚₀  1        1\n2│  φ₁‚₆ φ₁‚₄  1        2\n3│  φ₂‚₂ φ₁‚₈ -1        5\n6│ φ″₁‚₃ φ₂‚₅  1        4\n5│ φ′₁‚₃ φ₂‚₃ -1        3\n7│  φ₂‚₁ φ₂‚₁ -1        5\n4│³D₄[1] φ₃‚₂  1        5\n\nAbove  we explore the 3-series corresponding  to R_𝐓^𝐆(Id) where 𝐆 is the  triality group  and 𝐓  is the  torus of  type (q²+q+1)².

In  the  column  'φ' the name of the character  of W_𝐆(𝐓) corresponding  to the unipotent  character γᵩ is shown;  in the column  'ε' we show  the sign (-1)^nᵩ.

For cyclic groups W_𝐆(𝐋λ) we display the  parameters in  the table  since they  are associated  to characters of W_𝐆(𝐋λ). Finally the mention '(mod 3)' which appears in the 'φ' column means that in this case the axioms leave an ambiguity in the correspondence between  unipotent  characters  γᵩ  and  characters  ϕ (as well as with parameters):  the correspondence is known only up to a translation by 3 (in this case, the same as a global multiplication of all ϕ by -1).\n\nFinally,  we should note that  if the reflection group  or coset W is not defined  over the integers,  what counts is  not cyclotomic polynomials but factors  of them  over the  field of  definition of  W.

Let 𝐒 be the torus beginpmatrixh00h^-1 endpmatrix of SL₂ and let 𝐓 be a maximal  torus containing 𝐒, so that 𝐒  is the image of a one-parameter subgroup  σ∈ Y(𝐓). Consider the root decomposition 𝔤=_αΣ𝔤_α given by  𝐓; then  α↦⟨σ,α⟩ defines  a linear  form on  Σ, determined by its value  on simple roots. It  is possible to choose  a system of simple roots Π  so that ⟨σ,α⟩≥ 0 for α∈Π,  and then ⟨σ,α⟩∈{0,1,2} for any α∈Π. The  Dynkin diagram of Π decorated by  these values 0,1,2 is called the Dynkin-Richardson  diagram of e, and in good characteristic is a complete invariant of its 𝔤-orbit.\n\nLet  𝓑  be  the  variety  of  all  Borel  subgroups  and  let 𝓑ᵤ be the subvariety  of Borel subgroups  containing the unipotent  element u. Then dim C_𝐆(u)=rank 𝐆 + 2 dim 𝓑_u and in good characteristic this dimension can  be computed from  the Dynkin-Richardson diagram:  the dimension of the class of u is the number of roots α such that ⟨σ,α⟩∉{0,1}.\n\nWe   describe  now  the  Springer  correspondence.  Indecomposable  locally constant  𝐆-equivariant  sheaves  on  C,  called  local  systems, are parameterized  by irreducible characters of A(u). The ordinary Springer correspondence  is a bijection  between irreducible characters  of the Weyl group  and a large subset  of the local systems  which contains all trivial local  systems (those parameterized by the  trivial character of A(u) for each  u).  More  generally,  the  generalized  Springer  correspondence associates  to each local  system a (unique  up to 𝐆-conjugacy) cuspidal pair  of a Levi  subgroup 𝐋 of  𝐆 and a  cuspidal local system on an unipotent  class of 𝐋, such that the set of local systems associated to a given cuspidal pair is parameterized by the characters of the relative Weyl group W_𝐆 (𝐋)=N_𝐆 (𝐋)𝐋. There are only few cuspidal pairs.\n\nThe  Springer correspondence gives information on the character values of a finite  reductive  groups  as  follows:  assume  that  k is the algebraic closure of a finite field 𝔽_q and that F is the Frobenius attached to an  𝔽_q-structure of 𝐆. Let C  be an F-stable unipotent class and let  u C^F;  we  call  C  the  geometric  class  of  u  and the 𝐆^F-classes  inside  C^F  are  parameterized  by  the F-conjugacy classes  of A(u), denoted H¹(F,A(u)) (most of  the time we can find u such  that F acts trivially  on A(u) and H¹(F,A(u))  is then just the conjugacy  classes). To an F-stable character  φ of A(u) we associate the  characteristic function of the  corresponding local system (actually associated to an extension φ̃ of φ to A(u).F); it is a class function Y_uφ on 𝐆^F which can be normalized so that: Y_uφ(u₁)=φ(cF)  if u₁ is  geometrically conjugate to  u and its 𝐆^F-class  is parameterized by the  F-conjugacy class cF of A(u), otherwise Y_uφ(u₁)=0. If the pair u,φ corresponds via the Springer correspondence to the character χ of W_𝐆(𝐋), then Y_uφ is also denoted  Yᵪ. There  is another  important class  of functions  indexed by local  systems: to a local system on  class C is attached an intersection cohomology  complex, which is a complex of sheaves supported on the closure C̄.  To  such  a  complex  of  sheaves  is associated its characteristic function,  a class function of 𝐆^F  obtained by taking the alternating trace  of the Frobenius acting on the  stalks of the cohomology sheaves. If Y_ψ   is   the   characteristic   function   of  a  local  system,  the characteristic   function  of  the  corresponding  intersection  cohomology complex  is denoted  by X_ψ.  This function  is supported  on C̄, and Lusztig  has shown that X_ψ=ᵩ P_ψχ Yᵪ where P_ψχ are integer polynomials  in q and Yᵪ are attached to local systems on classes lying in C̄.\n\nLusztig   and  Shoji  have  given  an   algorithm  to  compute  the  matrix P_ψχ,   which  is  implemented  in  Chevie.  The  relationship  with characters   of  𝐆(𝔽_q),  taking  to  simplify  the  ordinary  Springer correspondence,  is that the  restriction to the  unipotent elements of the almost  character R_χ is equal to q^bᵪ Xᵪ, where bᵪ is dim 𝓑ᵤ for  an element u of the class C  such that the support of χ is C̄. The restriction of the Deligne-Lusztig characters R_w to the unipotents are  called the Green functions  and can also be  computed by Chevie. The values  of  all  unipotent  characters  on  unipotent  elements can also be computed  in principle by applying  Lusztig's Fourier transform matrix (see the  section on the Fourier  matrix) but there is  a difficulty in that the Xᵪ must be first multiplied by some roots of unity which are not known in all  cases (and when known may depend on the congruence class of q modulo some small primes).\n\nWe illustrate these computations on some examples:\n\njulia> UnipotentClasses(rootdatum(:sl,4))\nUnipotentClasses(sl₄)\n1111<211<22<31<4\n   u│D-R dBu B-C          C(u) A₃(A₃₍₎=Φ₁³) A₁(A₃₍₁₃₎=A₁×A₁Φ₁)/-1 .(A₃)/ζ₄\n────┼──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4   │222   0 222         q³.Z₄          1:4                  -1:2    ζ₄:Id\n31  │202   1 22.    q⁴.A₁₍₎=Φ₁        Id:31                               \n22  │020   2 2.2      q⁴.A₁.Z₂         2:22                 11:11         \n211 │101   3 2.. q⁵.A₂₍₁₎=A₁Φ₁       Id:211                               \n1111│000   6 ...

The partial order on unipotent  classes given by Zariski closure  is given before the table. The column   'D-R',   displayed   only   in   good  characteristic,  gives  the Dynkin-Richardson  diagram  for  each  class;  the  column  'dBu' gives the dimension  of  the  variety  𝓑ᵤ.  The  column 'B-C' gives the Bala-Carter classification  of u, that is  in the case of  sl₄ it displays u as a regular  unipotent  in  a  Levi  subgroup  by  giving the Dynkin-Richardson diagram  of a regular  unipotent (all 2's)  at entries corresponding to the Levi  and '.' at  entries which do  not correspond to  the Levi. The column 'C(u)'  describes the  group C_𝐆(u):  a power  qᵈ describes  that the unipotent  radical  of  C_𝐆(u)  has  dimension  d (thus qᵈ rational points);  then follows a  description of the  reductive part of the neutral component  of C_𝐆(u),  given by  the name  of its  root datum.  Then if C_𝐆(u)  is  not  connected,  the  description  of A(u) is given using another  vocabulary: a  cyclic group  of order  4 is  given as  'Z4', and a symmetric group on 3 points would be given as 'S3'.\n\nFor  instance, the first class '4'  has C_𝐆(u)^0 unipotent of dimension 3  and A(u) equal to 'Z4', the cyclic  group of order 4. The class '22' has  C_G(u) with unipotent radical of  dimension 4, reductive part of type  'A1' and  A(u) is  'Z2', that  is the  cyclic group of order 2. The other  classes have C_𝐆(u) connected. For  the class '31' the reductive part of C_G(u) is a torus of rank 1.\n\nThen  there is one column for each Springer series, giving for each class the pairs 'a:b' where 'a' is the name of the character of A(u) describing the  local system  involved and  'b' is  the name  of the  character of the (relative)  Weyl group corresponding by the Springer correspondence. At the top  of the column is  written the name of  the relative Weyl group, and in brackets  the name  of the  Levi affording  a cuspidal  local system; next, separated  by a / is a description of the central character associated to the  Springer series  (omitted if  this central  character is trivial): all local  systems  in  a  given  Springer  series have same restriction to the center of 𝐆. To find what the picture becomes for another algebraic group in  the  same  isogeny  class,  for  instance the adjoint group, one simply discards the Springer series whose central character becomes trivial on the center  of 𝐆; and  each group A(u)  has to be  quotiented by the common kernel  of  the  remaining  characters.

Also, from the 'B-C' column, we see that that class is not in a  proper Levi,  in which  case the  Bala-Carter diagram coincides with the Dynkin-Richardson diagram.\n\nThe  characteristics 2 and  3 are not  good for 'G2'.

Here ι is a 𝐆-equivariant local system on  the  class  C  of  a  unipotent  element  u. Such a local system is parametrized  by the pair  (u,ϕ) of u  and a character  of the group of components   A(u)   of   C_𝐆   (u).   The  function  Y_ι  is  the characteristic   function  of  this   local  system  and   X_ι  is  the characteristic   function  of  the  corresponding  intersection  cohomology complex  on C̄. The  Springer correspondence says  that the local systems can  also be  indexed by  characters of  a relative  Weyl group.  Since the coefficient of Xᵪ on Yᵩ is 0 if χ and φ are not characters of the same  relative Weyl group (are not in  the same Springer series), the table is  for one  Springer series,  specified by  the argument  'seriesNo' (this defaults  to 'seriesNo=1' which is the principal series).

There  are  several  interesting  cases  where  the relative group N_W(Lwϕ)L,  or a subgroup of it normalizing some further data attached to L, is itself a reflection group.\n\nA first example is the case where ϕ=1 and w=1, W is the Weyl group of a   finite  reductive   group  𝐆^F   and  the   Levi  subgroup  𝐋^F corresponding  to L has a cuspidal unipotent character. Then N_W(L)L is  a  Coxeter  group  acting  on  the  space  X(Z𝐋)⊗ℝ.  A  combinatorial characterization of such parabolic subgroups of Coxeter groups is that they are  normalized by the  longest element of  larger parabolic subgroups (see 5.7.1 Lusztig1976).\n\nA  second  example  is  when  L  is  trivial  and  wϕ is a ζ-regular element,  that is  the ζ-eigenspace  V_ζ of  wϕ contains  a vector outside  all the reflecting hyperplanes of W. Then N_W(Lwϕ)L=C_W(wϕ) is a reflection group in its action on V_ζ.\n\nA similar but more general example is when V_ζ is the ζ-eigenspace of some  element of  the reflection  coset Wϕ,  and is  of maximal dimension among such possible ζ-eigenspaces. Then the set of elements of Wϕ which act  by ζ on V_ζ is a certain subcoset Lwϕ, and N_W(Lwϕ)L is a reflection group in its action on V_ζ (see 2.5 Lehrer-Springer1999).\n\nFinally,  a  still  more  general  example,  but which only occurs for Weyl groups  or  Spetsial  reflection  groups,  is  when 𝐋 is a ζ-split Levi subgroup  (which means that  the corresponding subcoset  Lwϕ is formed of all  the elements which act by ζ on  some subspace V_ζ of V), and λ is  a  d-cuspidal  unipotent  character  of  𝐋  (which  means  that the multiplicity  of ζ  as a  root of  the degree  of λ  is the same as the multiplicity  of ζ as a root of the generic order of the semi-simple part of  𝐆); then N_W(Lwϕλ)L is a complex reflection group in its action on V_ζ.\n\nFurther,  in the above cases the relative group describes the decomposition of a Lusztig induction.\n\nWhen  𝐆^F is  a finite  reductive group,  and λ  a cuspidal unipotent character  of  the  Levi  subgroup  𝐋^F,  then the 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra  of  the  Harish-Chandra  induced  representation R_𝐋^𝐆(λ) is a Hecke algebra attached to the group N_W(L)L, thus the dimension of the characters  of this group describe the multiplicities in the Harish-Chandra induced.\n\nSimilarly, when 𝐋 is a ζ-split Levi subgroup, and λ is a d-cuspidal unipotent  character of  𝐋 then  (conjecturally) the 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra  of the Lusztig induced R_𝐋^𝐆(λ)  is a cyclotomic Hecke algebra for  to the  group N_W(Lwϕλ)L.  The constituents  of R_𝐋^𝐆(λ) are called  a  ζ-Harish-Chandra  series.  In  the  case of rational groups or cosets,  corresponding to finite  reductive groups, the  conjugacy class of Lwϕ  depends  only  on  the  order  d  of  ζ,  so  one  also talks of d-Harish-Chandra  series. These series correspond to ℓ-blocks where l is  a prime divisor of Φ_d(q) which  does not divide any other cyclotomic factor of the order of 𝐆^F.\n\nThe functions described in this module allow to explore these situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Gapjm.Eigenspaces.relative_degrees","page":"Gapjm Documentation","title":"Gapjm.Eigenspaces.relative_degrees","text":"relative_degrees(WF,d)\n\nLet  WF be a reflection group or a reflection coset.
