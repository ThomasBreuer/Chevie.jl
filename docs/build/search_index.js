If you are more competent  that me and see anything to  be improved in this package, please write me or make a pull request.\n\nInstalling\n\nTo install this package, at the Julia command line:\n\nenter package mode with ]\ndo the command\n\n(v1.0) pkg> add \"https://github.com/jmichel7/Gapjm.jl\"\n\nexit package mode with backspace and then do \n\njulia> using Gapjm\n\nand you are set up.\n\nTo update later to the latest version, do\n\n(v1.0) pkg> update \"https://github.com/jmichel7/Gapjm.jl\"\n\nThe package currently contains:\n\ninfrastructure\n\nPermutations,  cyclotomic  numbers,  Laurent  polynomials.  There  are also permutation  groups, for which I have  often replaced the proper algorithms of  GAP by naive but  easy to write methods  only suitable for small groups (sufficient  for the rest of the package but maybe not for your needs). The code  for infrastructure is often competitive  with GAP, despite being much shorter (often 100 lines of Julia replace 1000 lines of C); I am sure there are more optimisations possible. Any comments about the code and the design are welcome.\n\nported from Chevie\n\nabout 75% of Chevie functionality. The function gap can help you discover the  equivalent functionality  to a  Gap3 function:  it takes  a string and gives you Julia translations of functions in Gap3 which match this string:\n\njulia> Gapjm.gap(\"words\")\nCoxeterWords(W[,l])      =>  word.(Ref(W),elements(W[,l])\nGarsideWords             =>  elements\nCharRepresentationWords  =>  traces_words_mats\n\nThen you can call on-line help on the discovered functions.\n\nThis package is  often 10 times faster  than the equivalent GAP3 Chevie code (after the maddeningly long compilation time on first execution).\n\nI tried that parts of my package can be used independently of the rest. For instance,  the modules Combinat,  Groups, ModuleElts, Perms, Util are independent of the rest of the package and can be used stand-alone.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","text":"","category":"page"},{"location":"#Perms.jl-Documentation-1","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Perms.jl Documentation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"#","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","text":"Perms\nPerm\nlargest_moved_point\nsmallest_moved_point\nPerms.order\nPerms.orbit\nPerms.orbits\ncycles\ncycletype\nsign\nPerms.restricted\nreflength","category":"page"},{"location":"#Gapjm.Perms","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Gapjm.Perms","text":"This module is a port of the GAP permutations type.\n\nA  permutation here is a permutation of the set 1:n and is represented as a  vector of n integers representing the images of 1:n. The integer n is called the degree of the permutation, even if it is not moved. We follow the  GAP design: it is possible to multiply, or to store in the same group, permutations of different degrees; this is implemented by promoting both to the   higher  degree.  Slightly  faster  is  the  MAGMA  design  where  any permutation  has to belong to a group  and the degree is determined by that group; then multiplication of permutations within a given group is slightly faster,  but  it  is  more  difficult  to multiply permutations coming from different  groups, like a group and one  of its subgroups. The degree is an implementation  detail so usually it should  not be used. One should rather use the function largest_moved_point.\n\nThe default constructor for a permutation uses the list of images of 1:n, like  Perm([2,3,1,5,4]).  Often  it  is  more  convenient  to  use  cycle decompositions:    the   above   permutation    has   cycle   decomposition (1,2,3)(4,5)    thus   can   be    written   Perm(1,2,3)*Perm(4,5)   or perm\"(1,2,3)(4,5)\".  The list of images of  1:n can be gotten back from the  permutation by the function vec;  note that since equal permutations may have different degrees, they may have different vec.\n\nThe  complete type of a permutation  is Perm{T} where T<:Integer, where Vector{T}  is the type of the vector which holds the image of 1:n. This can  be used to save space or  time. For instance Perm{UInt8} can be used for  Weyl groups of rank≤8 since they have at most 240 roots. If T is not specified  we take it to be Int16 since this is a good compromise between speed and compactness.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> a=Perm(1,2,3)\n(1,2,3)\n\njulia> vec(a)\n3-element Array{Int16,1}:\n 2\n 3\n 1\n\njulia> a==Perm(vec(a))\ntrue\n\njulia> b=Perm(1,2,3,4)\n(1,2,3,4)\n\njulia> a*b     # product\n(1,3,2,4)\n\njulia> inv(a)  # inverse\n(1,3,2)\n\njulia> a/b     # quotient  a*inv(b)\n(3,4)\n\njulia> a\b     # left quotient inv(a)*b\n(1,4)\n\njulia> a^b     # conjugation inv(b)*a*b\n(2,3,4)\n\njulia> b^2\n(1,3)(2,4)\n\njulia> 1^a     # apply a to point 1\n2\n\njulia> one(a)\n()\n\njulia> sign(a)\n1\n\njulia> order(a)\n3\n\njulia> largest_moved_point(a)\n3\n\njulia> smallest_moved_point(a)\n1\n\njulia> Perm{Int8}(a) # convert to Perm{Int8}\nPerm{Int8}: (1,2,3)\n\njulia> Matrix(b)\n4×4 Array{Bool,2}:\n 0  1  0  0\n 0  0  1  0\n 0  0  0  1\n 1  0  0  0\n\njulia> rand(Perm,10)\n(1,8,4,2,9,7,5,10,3,6)\n\n\nPerms  have methods copy,  hash, ==, cmp,  isless (total order) so they can  be keys in hashes  or elements of sets;  two permutations are equal if they  move the same points to the same images.

This is tremendously useful but  needs a new type of number to be added to Julia, which I am not competent enough to try.\n\nThe main way to build a Cyclotomic number is to use the function E(n,k=1) which constructs ζₙᵏ.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> E(3)+E(4)\nCyc{Int64}: ζ₁₂⁴-ζ₁₂⁷-ζ₁₂¹¹\n\njulia> E(3,2)\nCyc{Int64}: ζ₃²\n\njulia> 1+E(3,2)\nCyc{Int64}: -ζ₃\n\njulia> a=E(4)-E(4)\nCyc{Int64}: 0\n\njulia> conductor(a) # a is lowered to ℚ (ζ_1)=ℚ \n1\n\njulia> typeof(convert(Int,a))\nInt64\n\njulia> convert(Int,E(4))\nERROR: InexactError: convert(Int64, E(4))\n\njulia> c=inv(1+E(4)) # inverses need Rationals\nCyc{Rational{Int64}}: 1/2-ζ₄/2\n\njulia> typeof(c)\nCyc{Rational{Int64}}\n\njulia> typeof(1+E(4))\nCyc{Int64}\n\njulia> Cyc(1+im) # one can convert Gaussian integers or rationals\nCyc{Int64}: 1+ζ₄\n\njulia> 1//(1+E(4))\nCyc{Rational{Int64}}: 1/2-ζ₄/2\n\njulia> typeof(Cyc(1//2)) # another way of building a Cyc\nCyc{Rational{Int64}}\n\njulia> conj(1+E(4))\nCyc{Int64}: 1-ζ₄\n\njulia> c=E(9)   # an effect of the Zumbroich basis\nCyc{Int64}: -ζ₉⁴-ζ₉⁷\n\njulia> Root1(c) # but you can decide whether a Cyc is a root of unity\nRoot1: 1/9\n\njulia> c=Complex(E(3))   # convert to float is probably not very useful\n-0.4999999999999998 + 0.8660254037844387im\n\nCycs have methods copy, hash, ==, cmp, isless (total order) so they can be keys in hashes or elements of sets.\n\nFor more information see the methods ER, Quadratic, galois. \n\nFinally, a benchmark:\n\njulia> function testmat(p) \n         ss=[[i,j] for i in 0:p-1 for j in i+1:p-1]\n         [(E(p,i'*reverse(j))-E(p,i'*j))//p for i in ss,j in ss]\n       end\ntestmat (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> @btime testmat(12)^2;\n  459.521 ms (9640239 allocations: 554.47 MiB)\n\nThe equivalent in GAP:\n\ntestmat:=function(p)local ss;ss:=Combinations([0..p-1],2);\n  return List(ss,i->List(ss,j->(E(p)^(i*Reversed(j))-E(p)^(i*j))/p));\nend; \n\ntestmat(12)^2 takes 0.4s in GAP3, 0.3s in GAP4\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Gapjm.Cycs.galois","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Gapjm.Cycs.galois","text":"galois(c::Cyc,n::Int) applies to c the galois automorphism   of Q(ζ_conductor(c)) raising all roots of unity to the n-th power.   n should be prime to c.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> galois(1+E(4),-1) # galois(c,-1) is the same as conj(c)\nCyc{Int64}: 1-ζ₄\n\njulia> galois(ER(5),2)==-ER(5)\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Gapjm.Cycs.ER","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Gapjm.Cycs.ER","text":"ER(n::Int) computes as a Cyc the square root of the integer n.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> ER(-1)\nCyc{Int64}: ζ₄\n\njulia> ER(3)\nCyc{Int64}: √3\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Gapjm.Cycs.Quadratic","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Gapjm.Cycs.Quadratic","text":"Quadratic(c::Cyc) \n\ndetermines  if c lives  in a quadratic  extension of ℚ.

It is true (but a non-trivial theorem) that in a Coxeter group the  order of st is exactly m(s,t), thus a Coxeter group is the same as a  Coxeter system, that is a pair (W,S) of a group W and a set S of involutions,  such that the group is  presented by relations describing the order  of the product of two elements of S. A Coxeter group has a natural representation, its reflection representation, on a real vector space V of  dimension length(S) (the Coxeter rank  of W), where each element of S  acts as a  reflection; the faithfulness  of this representation in the main  argument to prove  that the order  of st is  exactly m(s,t). Thus Coxeter groups are real reflection groups. The converse need not be true if the  set of reflecting  hyperplanes has bad  topological properties, but it turns out that finite Coxeter groups are the same as finite real reflection groups.  The possible Coxeter matrices for  finite Coxeter groups have been completely  classified; the corresponding finite groups play a deep role in several areas of mathematics.\n\nCoxeter  groups  have  a  nice  solution  to the word problem. The length l(w)  of an element  w∈ W is  the minimum number  of elements of S of which it is a product (since the elements of S are involutions, we do not need inverses). An expression of w of minimal length is called a reduced word  for w. The main property of  reduced words is the exchange lemma which  states that if s₁…sₖ is a  reduced word for w (thusk=l(w)) and s∈  S is such that l(sw)≤l(w) then one  of the sᵢ in the word for w can be deleted to obtain a reduced word for sw. Thus given s∈ S and w∈ W,  either l(sw)=l(w)+1 or  l(sw)=l(w)-1 and we  say in this last case that  s belongs to  the left descent  set of w.  The computation of a reduced word for an element, and other word problems, are easily done if we know  the left descent sets. For the Coxeter groups that we implement, this left  descent set  can be  easily determined  (see e.g. 'CoxSym' below), so this suggests how to deal with Coxeter groups.\n\nThe type CoxeterGroup is an abstact type; an actual struct which implements it must define a function\n\nisleftdescent(W,w,i) which tells whether the       i-th element of S is in the left descending set of w.\n\nthe other functions needed in an instance of a Coxeter group are\n\ngens(W) which returns the set S (the list of Coxeter generators)\nnref(W) which  returns the  number of  reflections of  W, if  W is  finite or nothing if W is infinite\n\nIt  should be  noted that  a Coxeter group can be any kind of group implementing the above functions.\n\nA  common occurrence in code for Coxeter groups is a loop like:\n\nfindfirst(x->isleftdescent(W,w,x),eachindex(gens(W)))\n\nif you provide a function firstleftdescent(W,w) it will be called instead of the above loop.\n\nBecause  of the  easy solution  of the  word problem  in Coxeter  groups, a convenient  way  to  represent  their  elements  is as words in the Coxeter generators.  They are represented as lists of labels for the generators. By default  these labels are  given as the  index of a  generator in S, so a Coxeter  word is just  a list of  integers in 1:length(S). For reflection subgroups, the labels are indices of the reflections in the parent group.\n\nThe functions 'word' and 'W(...)' will do the conversion between Coxeter words and elements of the group.\n\nExamples\n\njulia> W=CoxSym(4)\n𝔖 ₄\n\njulia> p=W(1,3,2,1,3)\nPerm{UInt8}: (1,4)\n\njulia> word(W,p)\n5-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 2\n 1\n\n\nWe  notice that the word we started with and the one that we ended up with, are not the same, though they represent the same element of W. The reason is  that the function 'word' computes a lexicographically smallest word for w.  Below  are  some  other  possible  computations with the same Coxeter group:\n\njulia> word(W,longest(W))  # the (unique) longest element in W\n6-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 3\n 2\n 1\n\njulia> w0=longest(W)\nPerm{UInt8}: (1,4)(2,3)\njulia> length(W,w0)\n6\njulia> map(i->word(W,reflection(W,i)),1:nref(W))\n6-element Array{Array{Int64,1},1}:\n [1]\n [2]\n [3]\n [1, 2, 1]\n [2, 3, 2]\n [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\njulia> [length(elements(W,i)) for i in 0:nref(W)]\n7-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 3\n 5\n 6\n 5\n 3\n 1\n\n\nThe above line tells us that there is 1 element of length 0, there are 6 of length 3, …\n\nFor  most basic functions the convention is that the input is an element of the  group, rather than  a Coxeter word.  The reason is  that for a Coxeter group  which  is  a  permutation  group,  using the low level functions for permutations  is usually  much faster  than manipulating lists representing reduced expressions.\n\nThis  file contains mostly a port of  the basic functions on Coxeter groups in  Chevie.

Finite Coxeter groups  coincide with the finite  subgroups of  GL(V) which  can be  generated y reflections. Weyl groups  are  the  finite  Coxeter  groups  which  can  be defined over the rational   numbers.  We  implement  finite   Coxter  groups  as  groups  of permutations  of  a  root  system.  Root  systems play an important role in mathematics as they classify semi-simple Lie algebras and algebraic groups.\n\nLet  us give precise definitions. Let V  be a real vector space, Vⱽ its dual  and let (,)  be the natural  pairing between Vⱽ  and V. A root system  is a finite set  of vectors R which  generate V (the roots), together  with  a  map  r↦  rⱽ  from  R  to  a subset Rⱽ of Vⱽ (the coroots) such that:\n\nFor any r∈  R, we have  (rⱽ,r)=2 so that  the formula x↦ x-(rⱽ,x)r\n\ndefines a reflection s_r:V→ V with root r and coroot rⱽ.\n\nThe reflection s_r stabilizes R.\n\nWe  will only  consider reduced  root systems,  i.e., such  that the only elements  of R colinear with r∈ R are r and -r; for Weyl groups, we also ask that the root system be crystallographic, that is (rⱽ,s) is an integer, for any s∈ R,rⱽ∈ Rⱽ.\n\nThe  subgroup W=W(R) of  GL(V) generated by  the reflections s_r is a finite  Coxeter group; when R is crystallographic, the representation V of  W  is  defined  over  the  rational  numbers.  All finite-dimensional (complex)  representations of a  finite Coxeter group  can be realized over the  same field  as V.  Weyl groups  can be  characterized amongst finite Coxeter  groups by the fact that all numbers m(s,t) in the Coxeter matrix are in {2,3,4,6}.\n\nIf  we identify  V with  Vⱽ by  choosing a  W-invariant bilinear form (.;.);  then we have rⱽ=2r/(r;r). A root system R is irreducible if it is not the union of two orthogonal subsets. If R is reducible then the corresponding  Coxeter group  is the  direct product  of the Coxeter groups associated with the irreducible components of R.\n\nThe  irreducible  crystallographic  root  systems  are  classified  by  the following  list of  Dynkin diagrams,  which, in  addition to  the Coxeter matrix,  encode also the relative length of the roots. We show the labeling of the nodes given by the function 'Diagram' described below.\n\nA_n O—O—O—…—O   B_n O⇐O—O—…—O  C_n O⇒ O—O—…—O  D_n  O 2\n    1 2 3 … n       1 2 3 … n      1  2 3 … n       ￨\n                                                  O—O—…—O\n                                                  1 3 … n\n\nG₂ O⇛ O  F₄ O—O⇒ O—O  E₆   O 2   E₇   O 2     E₈    O 2\n   1  2     1 2  3 4       ￨          ￨             ￨\n                       O—O—O—O—O  O—O—O—O—O—O   O—O—O—O—O—O—O\n                       1 3 4 5 6  1 3 4 5 6 7   1 3 4 5 6 7 8\n\nThese diagrams encode the presentation of the Coxeter group W as follows: the vertices represent the generating reflections; an edge is drawn between s  and t if the order m(s,t) of st is greater than 2; the edge is single  if  m(s,t)=3,  double  if  m(s,t)=4,  triple if m(s,t)=6. The arrows  indicate the relative root lengths when W has more than one orbit on  R, as explained below; we  get the Coxeter Diagram, which describes the  underlying Weyl group, if  we ignore the arrows:  we see that the root systems B_n and C_n correspond to the same Coxeter group.\n\nHere  are  the  diagrams  for  the  finite  Coxeter  groups which  are  not crystallographic:\n\n       e        5         5\nI₂(e) O—O   H₃ O—O—O  H₄ O—O—O—O\n      1 2      1 2 3     1 2 3 4 \n\nLet us now describe how the root systems are encoded in these diagrams. Let R  be a root system in V. Then we can choose a linear form on V which vanishes  on no element of R. According to  the sign of the value of this linear  form on a root  r ∈ R we  call r positive or negative. Then there  exists a unique subset Π of  the positive roots, called the set of simple  roots, such that  any positive root  is a linear combination with non-negative  coefficients of  roots in  Π. Any  two sets of simple roots (corresponding  to  different  choices  of  linear  forms  as above) can be transformed into each other by a unique element of W(R). Hence, since the pairing  between V and Vⱽ  is W-invariant, if Π  is a set of simple roots  and if  we define  the Cartan  matrix as  being the  n times n matrix   C={rⱽ(s)}_{rs},  for  r,s∈Π  this   matrix  is  unique  up  to simultaneous  permutation of rows and columns.  It is precisely this matrix which is encoded in a Dynkin diagram, as follows.\n\nThe  indices for the rows of C label the nodes of the diagram. The edges, for  r ≠ s, are  given as follows. If  C_{rs} and C_{sr} are integers such  that |C_{rs}|≥|C_{sr}|=1  the vertices  are connected by |C_{rs}| lines,  and if |C_{rs}|>1  then we put  an additional arrow  on the lines pointing  towards the node with label s.  In other cases, we simply put a single   line  equipped  with  the  unique  integer  p_{rs}≥1  such  that C_{rs}C_{sr}=cos^2 (π/p_{sr}).\n\nConversely,  the whole root  system can be  recovered from the simple roots and  the corresponding coroots. The  reflections in W(R) corresponding to the  simple roots are called  simple reflections or Coxeter generators. They are precisely the generators for which the Coxeter diagram encodes the defining  relations of W(R). Each root is  in the orbit of a simple root, so  that R is obtained  as the orbit of  the simple roots under the group generated  by  the  simple  reflections.  The  restriction  of  the  simple reflections  to the span of R is  determined by the Cartan matrix, so R is determined by the Cartan matrix and the set of simple roots.\n\nThe  Cartan  matrix  corresponding  to  one  of  the above irreducible root systems  (with the specified labeling) is  returned by the command 'cartan' which  takes as input  a Symbol giving  the type (that  is ':A', ':B', …, ':I')  and a positive Int giving the  rank (plus an Int giving the bond for  type :I).  This function  returns a  matrix with  entries in ℤ for crystallographic  types, and a  matrix of Cyc  for the other types. Given two  Cartan matrices c1 and c2,  their matrix direct sum (corresponding to  the  orthogonal  direct  sum  of  the  root systems) can be produced by cat(c1,c2,dims=[1,2]).\n\nThe  function 'rootdatum' takes as input a  list of simple roots and a list of the corresponding coroots and produces a struct containing information about  the root system R and about W(R). If we label the positive roots by  '1:N', and the negative roots  by 'N+1:2N', then each simple reflection is  represented by the permutation of '1:2N' which it induces on the roots. If  only one argument is given, the Cartan matrix of the root system, it is taken  as the list  of coroots and  the list of  roots is assumed to be the canonical basis of V.\n\nIf one only wants to work with Cartan matrices with a labeling as specified by  the  above  list,  the  function  call  can  be  simplified. Instead of 'rootdatum(cartan(:D,4))' the following is also possible.\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:D,4)\nD₄\n\njulia> cartan(W)\n4×4 Array{Int64,2}:\n  2   0  -1   0\n  0   2  -1   0\n -1  -1   2  -1\n  0   0  -1   2\n\nAlso,  the Weyl group struct associated to a direct sum of irreducible root systems can be obtained as a product\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,2)*coxgroup(:B,2)\nA₂×B₂\n\njulia> cartan(W)\n4×4 Array{Int64,2}:\n  2  -1   0   0\n -1   2   0   0\n  0   0   2  -2\n  0   0  -1   2\n\nThe  same struct  is constructed  by applying  'coxgroup' to  the matrix 'cat(cartan(:A,2), cartan(:B,2),dims=[1,2])'.\n\nThe elements of a Weyl group are permutations of the roots:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:D,4)\nD₄\n\njulia> p=W(1,3,2,1,3)\n(1,14,13,2)(3,17,8,18)(4,12)(5,20,6,15)(7,10,11,9)(16,24)(19,22,23,21)\n\njulia> word(W,p)\n5-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 3\n 1\n 2\n 3\n\n\nfinally, a benchmark on julia 1.0.2\n\njulia> @btime length(elements(coxgroup(:E,7)))\n  531.385 ms (5945569 allocations: 1.08 GiB)\n\nGAP3 for the same computation takes 2.2s\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Gapjm.PermRoot.cartan","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Gapjm.PermRoot.cartan","text":"cartan(m)\n\nThe  argument is a Coxeter matrix for a Coxeter group W and the result is a  Cartan Matrix  for the  standard reflection  representation of  W.

A  complex reflection is an element  s∈ GL(V) of finite order whose  fixed point set is an hyperplane (we  will in the  following just call  it a reflection  to abbreviate; in some  literature the term reflection  is only employed when  the order is 2 and  the  more  general  case  is  called  a  pseudo-reflection).  Thus a reflection  has a unique  eigenvalue not equal  to 1, which  is a root of unity.  If  K  is  a  subfield  of  the  real numbers, this eigenvalue is necessarily equal to -1.\n\nA  reflection group W is a group  generated by a finite number of complex reflections.\n\nSince  when W contains  a reflection s  it contains its  powers, W is always  generated  by  reflections  s  with non-trivial eigenvalue E(d) where  d is the order of s; we may in addition assume that s is not a power  of another reflection with larger order. Such a reflection is called distinguished;  it is  a canonical  generator of  the cyclic  subgroup it generates.  The  generators  of  reflection  groups we construct are always distinguished  reflections. In a real  reflection group all reflections are distinguished.\n\nReflection groups for us are groups W with the following methods defined\n\ngens(W): the reflections which generate W\n\nreflections(W): a list of distinguished reflections, given as elements of W, which starts with gens(W).\n\nNote  that W  does not  need to  be a  matrix group. The meaning of the above  fields is just that W has a representation (called the reflection representation  of W) where  reflections(W) act as  reflections. It is much  more efficient  to compute  with permutation  groups than with matrix groups,  when possible.  Information sufficient  to determine  a particular reflection  representation  is  stored  for  such  groups  (see roots and coroots). Note that when W is finite, the distinguished reflections are in bijection with the reflecting hyperplanes.\n\nLet  W  be  a  finite  reflection  group  on  the vector space V over a subfield  K of the  complex numbers. An  efficient representation that we use  for computing with such group is, is a permutation representation on a W-invariant  set of root and coroot  vectors for reflections of W; that is,  a  set  R  of  pairs  (r,rᵛ)∈  V×Vᵛ invariant by W and such each distinguished  reflection  in  W  is  defined  by  some  pair in R (see reflection). There may be several pairs for each reflection, differing by roots  of unity. This generalizes the usual construction for Coxeter groups (the  case K=ℝ) where to each reflection of W is associated two roots, a  positive and a negative one.  For irreducible complex reflection groups, there are at least as many roots on a given line as the order of the center of W.\n\nThe  finite  irreducible  complex  reflection  groups  have been completely classified   by  Shepard  and  Todd.   They  contain  one  infinite  family G(de,e,r) depending on 3 parameters, and 34 exceptional groups which have been  given by Shephard and Todd names which range from G₄ to G₃₇. They cover the exceptional Coxeter groups, e.g., coxgroup(:E,8) is the same as G₃₇.\n\nWe provide functions to build any finite reflection group, either by giving a  list of  roots and  corrots defining  the generating  reflections, or in terms  of the classification. The  output is a permutation  group on set of roots  (see ComplexReflectionGroup  and PermRootGroup).  In the context e.g.  of  Weyl  groups,  one  wants  to describe the particular root system chosen  in term of the  traditional classification of crystallographic root systems. This is done via calls to the function coxgroup (see the chapter on  finite Coxeter  groups). There  is not  yet a  general theory on how to construct  a nice set of  roots for a non-real  reflection group; the roots chosen  here  where  obtained  case-by-case;  however, they satisfy several important properties:\n\nThe  generating  reflections  satisfy  braid relations which  present the braid group associated to W (see Diagram).\nThe field of definition of W is the field K generated by the traces of the elements of W acting on V.\n\nIt  is a theorem that  W may be realized  as a reflection group over K. For  almost  all  irreducible  complex  reflection  groups,  the generating matrices  for W  we give  have coefficients  in K.  Further, the set of matrices  for all  elements of  W is  globally invariant under the Galois group  of K/ℚ, thus the Galois  action induces automorphisms of W. The exceptions are G₂₂, G₂₇ where the matrices are in a degree two extension of   K  (this  is  needed  to   have  a  globally  invariant  model,  see [MarinMichel10]) and some dihedral groups as well as H_3 and H_4, where the  matrices given (the usual  Coxeter reflection representation over K) are not globally invariant.\n\nIt turns out that all representations of a complex reflection group W are defined  over the  field of  definition of  W (cf.  [Ben76] and D.~Bessis thesis).  This has been known for a long  time in the case K=ℚ, the case of Weyl groups: their representations are defined over the rationals.\n\nThe Cartan matrix (see \"CartanMat\") for the generating roots (those which  correspond  to the generating reflections) has  entries in the ring ℤₖ  of integers of K, and the roots (resp. coroots) are linear combination  with coefficients in ℤₖ of a linearly independent subset of them.\n\nThe finite reflection groups have thus the following additional fields:\n\nroots:  a  set  of  complex  roots  in  V,  given  as a list of lists        (vectors), on which W has a faithful permutation representation.\n\n   `coroots`: the  coroots for `gens(W)`.\n\nHere  we  describe  functions  available  for  finite reflection groups W represented  as permutation groups on a  set of roots. These functions make use  of the classification of W whenever it is known, but work even if it is not known.\n\nLet SV be the symmetric algebra of V. The invariants of W in SV are called  the  polynomial  invariants  of  W.  They  are  generated  as a polynomial   ring   by   dim   V  homogeneous  algebraically  independent polynomials  f₁,…,f_{dim  V}.  The  polynomials  fᵢ  are not uniquely determined  but  their  degrees  are.  The  fᵢ  are  called  the  basic invariants  of W, and their degrees the reflection degrees of W. Let I be the ideal generated by the homogeneous invariants of positive degree in  SV. Then SV/I is isomorphic to the regular representation of W as a  W-module. It  is thus  a graded  (by the  degree of  elements of SV) version  of the regular  representation of W.  The polynomial which gives the  graded multiplicity  of a  character φ  of W  in the graded module SV/I is called the fake degree of φ.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Gapjm.PermRoot.reflection","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Gapjm.PermRoot.reflection","text":"reflection for i-th root of W\n\n\n\n\n\nreflection(root, coroot)::Matrix the reflection of given root and coroot\n\nA  (complex) reflection in GL(V), the linear group of a vector space over a subfield of the complex numbers, is a map s of finite order whose fixed points  are  a  hyperplane  H  (the  reflecting  hyperplane of s); an eigenvector  r for  the non-trivial  eigenvalue ζ  (a root of unity) is called  a root of s.

Let R be a commutative ring with 1 and for s∈ S let uₛ₀,uₛ₁∈ R be elements which depend ony on the conjugacy class of s in W (this is the same  as requiring that uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ whenever mₛₜ is odd). The Iwahori-Hecke algebra of W over R with parameters uₛᵢ is a deformation of the group algebra  of W over R defined as  follows: it is the unitary associative R-algebra generated by elements Tₛ, s∈ S subject to the relations:\n\n(Tₛ-uₛ₀)(Tₛ-uₛ₁)=0 for all s∈ S (the quadratic relations)\n\nTₛTₜTₛ= TₜTₛTₜ with mₛₜ factors on each side (the braid relations)\n\nIf  uₛ₀=1 and  uₛ₁=-1 for  all s  then the quadratic relations become Tₛ²=1 and the deformation of the group algebra is trivial.\n\nSince  the generators Tₛ satisfy the  braid relations, the algebra H is in  fact a quotient of the group algebra of the braid group associated with W.  It follows that, if w=s_1⋯ s_m  is a reduced expression of w ∈ W then  the  product  Tₛ_1⋯ Tₛ_m  depends  only  on w. We will therefore denote by T_w. We have T_1=1.\n\nIf  one of uₛ₀ or uₛ₁ is invertible  in R, for example uₛ₁, then by changing  the generators  to T′ₛ=-Tₛ/uₛ₁,  and setting qₛ=-uₛ₀/uₛ₁, the braid  relations do no change  (since when mₛₜ is  odd we have uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ) but  the quadratic relations become  (T′ₛ-qₛ)(T′ₛ+1)=0. This last form is the  most common  form considered  in the  literature. Another common form, considered  in  the  context  of  Kazhdan-Lusztig  theory, is uₛ₀=√qₛ and uₛ₁=-√qₛ⁻¹.  The general form of parameters provided is a special case of general cyclotomic Hecke algebras, and can be useful in many contexts.\n\nFor  some  algebras  the  character  table,  and in general Kazhdan-Lusztig bases,  require a square root of -uₛ₀uₛ₁.  We provide a way to specify it with  the  field  .rootpara  which  can  be  given  when constructing the algebra. If not given a root is automatically extracted when needed (and we know  how to compute it) by the function RootParameter. Note however that sometimes  an  explicit  choice  of  root  is  necessary  which  cannot  be automatically determined.\n\nThere  is a universal choice  for R and uₛᵢ:  Let uₛᵢ:s∈ S,i∈[0,1] be indeterminates   such  that  uₛᵢ=uₜᵢ  whenever  mₛₜ  is  odd,  and  let A=ℤ[uₛᵢ] be the corresponding polynomial ring. Then the Hecke algebra H of  W over a  with parameters uₛᵢ  is called the generic Iwahori-Hecke algebra  of  with  W.  Any  other  algebra  with parameters vₛᵢ can be obtained  by specialization from  H: There is  a unique ring homomorphism f:A  → R such that f(uₛᵢ)=vₛᵢ  for all i. Then we  can view R as an A-module via f and we can identify the other algebra to R _A H.\n\nThe  elements {T_w∣w∈ W} actually form an  R-basis of H if one of the uₛᵢ  is invertible for all s. The  structure constants in that basis is obtained  as  follows.  To  multiply  T_v  by  T_w,  choose  a  reduced expression for v, say v=s_1 ⋯ s_k and apply inductively the formula:\n\nT_sT_w=T_sw               if l(sw)=l(w)+1\n\nT_sT_w=-uₛ₀uₛ₁T_sw+(uₛ₀+uₛ₁)T_w if l(sw)=l(w)-1.\n\nIf all s we have uₛ₀=q, uₛ₁=-1 then we call the corresponding algebra the one-parameter or Spetsial Iwahori-Hecke algebra associated with W; it can  be obtained with the  simplified call 'hecke(W,q)'. Certain invariants of  the irreducible characters of  this algebra play a  special role in the representation  theory of the underlying  finite Coxeter groups, namely the a- and A-invariants. For basic properties of Iwahori-Hecke algebras and their  relevance to the representation theory of finite groups of Lie type, see for example Curtis and Reiner 1987, Sections~67 and 68.\n\nIn  the  following  example,  we  compute  the multiplication table for the 0-Iwahori–Hecke algebra associated with the Coxeter group of type A_2.\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,2)\nA₂\n\njulia> H=hecke(W,0)             # One-parameter algebra with `q=0`\nhecke(A₂,0)\n\njulia> T=Tbasis(H);             # Create the `T` basis\n\njulia> el=words(W)\n6-element Array{Array{Int8,1},1}:\n []       \n [2]      \n [1]      \n [2, 1]   \n [1, 2]   \n [1, 2, 1]\n\njulia> T.(el)*permutedims(T.(el))        # multiplication table\n6×6 Array{HeckeTElt{Perm{Int16},Int64,FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}},2}:\n T.

If  -uₛ₀uₛ₁ has a square  root  wₛ,  we  can  scale  the  basis  Tₛ  to  get  a new basis tₛ=-Tₛ/wₛ    with   quadratic    relations   (tₛ-vₛ)(tₛ+vₛ⁻¹)=0   where vₛ=wₛ/uₛ₁.   The  most  general  case   when  Kazhdan-Lusztig  bases  and polynomials  can be defined is when the parameters vₛ belong to a totally ordered  abelian group Γ  for multiplication, see  Lus83. We set Γ⁺= {γ∈ Γ∣γ>0} and Γ⁻={γ⁻¹∣γ∈ Γ⁺}={γ∈ Γ∣γ<0}.\n\nThus  we assume ℋ defined over the ring ℤ[Γ], the group algebra of Γ over  ℤ, and the quadratic  relations of ℋ  associate to each s∈ S a vₛ∈  Γ⁺ such that  (tₛ-vₛ)(tₛ+vₛ⁻¹)=0. We also  set qₛ=vₛ² and define the  basis Tₛ=vₛtₛ with quadratic relations (Tₛ-qₛ)(Tₛ+1)=0; for w∈ W with reduced expression w=s₁…sₙ we define q_w∈ Γ⁺ by q_w^½=v_{s₁}…v_{sₙ} and let q_w=(q_w^½)².\n\nWe  define the bar involution on ℋ  by linearity: on ℤ[Γ] we define it by  overline_γ Γa_γγ= _γ Γ a_γ γ¹ and we extend it to ℋ by  overline  Tₛ=Tₛ¹.  Then  the  Kazhdan-Lusztig  basis C′_w is defined  as  the  only  basis  of  ℋ  stable  by the bar involution and congruent to t_w modulo _w WΓ t_w.\n\nThe  basis C′_w can be computed  as follows. We define elements R_xy of  ℤ[Γ] by  T_y¹=_x overlineR_xy¹  q_x¹T_x. We  then define inductively  the Kazhdan-Lusztig  polynomials (in  this general  context we should  say the  Kazhdan-Lusztig elements  of ℤ[Γ],  which belong  to the subalgebra  of ℤ[Γ] generated by  the qₛ) by P_xw=τ_(q_wq_x)^½ (_xywR_xyP_yw)  where τ  is the  truncation: τ_nu _γ Γ a_γγ= _γnua_γγ; the induction is thus on decreasing x for the Bruhat order  and  starts  at  P_ww=1.  We  have  then  C_w=_y q_w^-12 P_ywT_y.\n\nThe  Chevie code  for the  Kazhdan-Lusztig bases  C, D and their primed versions, has been initially written by Andrew Mathas around 1994, who also contributed  to  the  design  of  the programs dealing with Kazhdan-Lusztig bases. He also implemented some other bases, such as the Murphy basis which can  be  found  in  the  Chevie  contributions  directory. The code for the unequal  parameters  case  has  been  written  around  1999  by F.Digne and J.Michel. The other Kazhdan-Lusztig bases are computed in terms of the C′ basis.\n\nWhen  the ℤ[Γ] is a  Laurent polynomial ring the  bar operation is taking the  inverse of  the variables,  and truncation  is keeping terms of degree smaller or equal to that of ν. It is possible to use arbitrary groups Γ as   long   as   methods   bar:_γ   Γ   a_γγ  _γ  Γ  a_γγ¹, positive_part  : _γ  Γ a_γγ  _γ 1  a_γγ and negative_part: _γ  Γ  a_γγ    _γ  1  a_γγ  have been defined on ℤ[Γ]. These operations   will   be   used   internally   by  the  programs  to  compute Kazhdan-Lusztig bases.\n\nfinally, benchmarks on julia 1.0.2\n\njulia> function test_kl(W)\n         q=Pol([1],1); H=hecke(W,q^2,rootpara=q)\n         C=Cpbasis(H); T=Tbasis(H)\n         [T(C(w)) for w in elements(W)]\n       end\ntest_kl (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> @btime test_kl(coxgroup(:F,4));\n2.265 s (22516606 allocations: 1.81 GiB)\n\nCompare to GAP3 where the following function takes 11s for F4\n\ntest_kl:=function(W)local q,H,T,C;\n  q:=X(Rationals);H:=Hecke(W,q^2,q);\n  T:=Basis(H,\"T\");C:=Basis(H,\"C'\");\n  List(Elements(W),e->T(C(e)));\nend;\n\nAnother benchmark:\n\nfunction test_kl2(W)\n  el=elements(W)\n  [KLPol(W,x,y) for x in el, y in el]\nend\n\ntest_kl2 (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia>@btime test_kl2(coxgroup(:F,4));\n  8s (97455915 allocations: 6.79 GiB)\n\nCompare to GAP3 where the following function takes 42s for F4\n\ntest_kl2:=function(W)local el;\n  el:=Elements(W);\n  List(el,x->List(el,y->KazhdanLusztigPolynomial(W,x,y)));\nend;\n\nWe provide also functionality to study the Kazhdan-Lusztig left cells (for the equal-parameter Hecke algebra).\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:H,3)\nH₃\n\njulia> c=LeftCells(W)\n22-element Array{LeftCell{FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Cyc{Int64}}},1}:\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo= character=φ₁‚₀>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=123 character=φ₁‚₁₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(15) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(10) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(14) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=7 character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(12) character=φ₅‚₅>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(9,12) character=φ₅‚₂>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(5,11) character=φ₅‚₂>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=13 character=φ₅‚₂>\n ⋮\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(8,13) character=φ₃‚₆+φ₃‚₈>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(1,15) character=φ₃‚₆+φ₃‚₈>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=3 character=φ₃‚₁+φ₃‚₃>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=2 character=φ₃‚₁+φ₃‚₃>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=1 character=φ₃‚₁+φ₃‚₃>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=6 character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(13) character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=(11) character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n LeftCell<H₃: duflo=9 character=φ₄‚₃+φ₄‚₄>\n\nsee  also  the  functions  elements,  character,  representation  and WGraph  for left  cells.

One can first run  a number of standard checks on a given  pair  of  elements  to  see  if the computation of the corresponding polynomial  can be reduced to a similar computation for elements of smaller length.

The implementation  of these last monoids is in the framework of a general implementation of Garside monoids.\n\nTo   define  them  we  first  need   to  introduce  some  vocabulary  about divisibility  in monoids. A left divisor of  x is a d such that there exists  y with x=dy (and then we say  that x is a right multiple of d).  We say that a monoid M  is left cancellable if an equality dx=dy implies  x=y. We define symmetrically  right divisors, left multiples and right cancellability. We say that x is an atom if it has no proper left divisor (that is a d such that x=dy with y≠1) apart from 1. A left gcd  of x and y is a common left  divisor d of x and y such that any  other common left divisor is a left divisor of d. Similarly a right lcm  of x and  y is a  common multiple which  is a left divisor of any other common multiple.\n\nWe  call Garside a monoid M which:\n\nis left and right cancellable.\nis generated by its atoms,  which are finite in number.\nadmits left and  right  gcds  and  lcms.\nis such that any element has only finitely many left (or right) divisors.\nadmits a Garside element, which is an element Δ whose set of left and right divisors coincide and generate M.\n\nGarside  elements are not  unique, but there  is a unique  minimal one (for divisibility);  we assume a  Garside element Δ  has been chosen. Then the divisors  of Δ are called  the simples of M.  A Garside monoid embeds into  its group of fractions, which is  called a Garside group (a Garside group  may have  several distinct  Garside structures,  as we  will see for Braid groups of finite Coxeter groups).\n\nWe  also implement locally Garside monoids,  which are monoids where lcms do  not always exist, but exist when any common multiple exists; the set of simples  is then not defined using a  Garside element, but by the condition that  they contain the atoms and are  closed under lcms and taking divisors (see  [BDM01]); since it is not ensured by the existence of Δ, one has to add  the condition that  any element is  divisible by finitely many simples (but  the number of simples can be infinite). The main example is the braid monoid of an infinite Coxeter group. It is not known if these monoids embed in  their group of fractions (though that has been proved for braid monoids of Coxeter groups by Paris [Paris01]) and thus computing in the monoid does not help for computing in the group (only the monoid is implemented here).\n\nWhat allows computing with Garside and locally Garside monoids, and Garside groups,  is the fact  that they admit  normal forms –-  these normal forms where exhibited for braid monoids of Coxeter groups by Deligne [Del72], who extended previous work of Brieskorn, Saito [BS72] and Garside [Gar69]:\n\n(i) Let  M be a locally Garside monoid and let b∈ M. Then there is a unique maximal left simple divisor α(b) of b, called the head of b –- any other simple dividing b on the left divides α(b) on the left.\n\n(ii) Assume  M is a Garside monoid, Δ is  its Garside element and G is its group  of fractions. Then,  given any element  x∈ G, there  is some power Δⁱ such that Δⁱ x∈ M.\n\nA consequence of (i) is that any element has a canonical decomposition as a product of simples, called its left-greedy normal form. If we define ω(x) by  x=α(x)ω(x), then the normal form of x is α(x)α(ω(x))α(ω^2(x))… We use  the normal form to represent elements  of M, and when M is Garside (ii)  to represent elements  of G: given  x∈ G we  compute the smallest power  i  such  that  Δⁱ  x∈  M,  and  we  represent  x by the couple (i,Δ⁻ⁱx).  We are thus reduced to the case where x∈ M, not divisible by Δ,  where we represent  x by the  sequence of simples which constitutes its normal form. We now describe Artin-Tits braid monoids. Let (W,S) be a Coxeter system, that is W has presentation\n\n⟨s∈ S∣s^2=1, sts⋯ =tst⋯   (mₛₜ factors on each side) for s,t∈ S⟩\n\nfor  some Coxeter matrix mₛₜ for s,t∈ S. The braid group B associated to (W,S) is the group defined by the presentation\n\n⟨𝐬∈ 𝐒∣ 𝐬𝐭𝐬⋯ =𝐭𝐬𝐭⋯  (mₛₜ factors on each side) for 𝐬,𝐭∈ 𝐒⟩\n\nThe positive braid monoid B⁺ associated to W is the monoid defined by the  presentation above –- it identifies to the submonoid of B generated by  𝐒 by  the result  of Paris  mentioned above.  This monoid  is locally Garside,  with set of simples  in bijection with elements  of W and atoms the elements of 𝐒; we will denote by 𝐖 the set of simples, and by 𝐰 ↦ w  the bijection between simples and elements  of W. The group W has a length  defined  in  terms  of  reduced expressions. Similarly, having only homogeneous relations, B⁺ has a natural length function. Then 𝐖 can be characterized  as the subset of the elements  of B⁺ of the same length as their image in W.\n\nIf  W is finite, then B⁺ is Garside with Garside element the element of 𝐖 whose image is the longest element  of W. A finite Coxeter group is also  a reflection group in  a real vector space,  thus in its complexified V,  and B has also a topological definition as the fundamental group of the  space Vʳᵉᵍ/W, where Vʳᵉᵍ  is the set of  elements of V which are fixed  by no  non-identity element  of S;  however, we  will not use this here.\n\nGiven a Coxeter group W,\n\nExamples\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:A,4)\nA₄\n\njulia> B=BraidMonoid(W)\nBraidMonoid(A₄)\n\nconstructs  the  associated  braid  monoid,  and  then  as  a  function 'B' constructs  elements of the braid monoid (or group when W is finite) from a list of generators.\n\njulia> w=B(1,2,3,4)\n1234\n\njulia> w^3\n121321432.343\n\njulia> word(W,α(w^3))\n9-element Array{Int64,1}:\n 1\n 2\n 1\n 3\n 2\n 1\n 4\n 3\n 2\n\njulia> w^4\nδ.232432\n\njulia> inv(w)\n(1234)⁻¹\n\nAs  seen in the fourth  line above, the function  'α(b)' returns the simple α(b)∈ 𝐖 as an element of W.\n\nHow  an element of  a Garside group  is printed is  controlled by IOcontext ':greedy'.  By default, elements are printed  as fractions a⁻¹b where a and  b have no left common divisor. Each  of a and b is printed using its left-greedy normal form, that is a maximal power of the Garside element followed  the rest.  One can  print the  entire element  in the left-greedy normal  from by setting the ':greedy' IOContext; with the same w as above we have:\n\njulia> repr(w^-1,context=IOContext(stdout,:greedy=>true,:limit=>true))\n\"δ⁻¹.232432\"\n\nFinally,  repr gives   w  back   in  a   form  which   after  assigning 'B=BraidMonoid(W)' can be input back into Julia:\n\njulia> repr(w)\n\"B(1,2,3,4)\"\n\njulia> repr(w^3)\n\"B(1,2,1,3,2,1,4,3,2,3,4,3)\"\n\njulia> repr(w^-1)\n\"B(-4,-3,-2,-1)\"\n\nIn  general elements of  a Garside monoid  are displayed thus  as a list of their constituting atoms.\n\nWe  now describe the dual braid monoid.  For that, we first give a possible approach  to construct Garside monoids. Given a  group W and a set S of generators  of W as a monoid, we  define the length l(w) as the minimum number of elements of S needed to write w. We then define left divisors of   x  as  the  d   such  that  there  exists   y  with  x=dy  and l(d)+l(y)=l(x).  We say that w∈ W is  balanced if its set of left and right  divisors coincide,  is a  lattice (where  upper and lower bounds are lcms and gcds) and generates W. Then we have:\n\nsuppose w is balanced and let [1,w] be its set of divisors (an interval for  the partial order  defined by divisibility).  Then the monoid M with generators  [1,w] and relations  xy=z whenever xy=z  holds in W and l(x)+l(y)=l(z)  is Garside,  with simples  [1,w] and  atoms S.  It is called the interval monoid defined by the interval [1,w].\n\nThe  Artin-Tits braid monoid  is an interval  monoid by taking  for S the Coxeter generators, in which case l is the Coxeter length, and taking for w  the longest element of W. The dual monoid, constructed by Birman, Ko and  Lee  for  type  A  and  by  Bessis  for  all  well-generated complex reflection  groups, is obtained in  a similar way, by  taking this time for S  the set of all reflections, and for w a Coxeter element; then l is the  reflection length  'reflength' (for  well-generated complex reflection groups  whihc are not real S contains only those reflections which divide w  for the  reflection length);  for the  dual monoid  the simples are of cardinality  the  generalized  Catalan  numbers.  An  interval  monoid  has naturally  an inverse morphism from M  to W, called 'EltBraid' which is the  quotient map from the  interval monoid to W  which sends back simple braids to [1,w]. #A  last notable  notion is  reversible monoids.  Since in Chevie we store #only  left normal forms, it is easy to compute left lcms and gcds, but hard #to  compute right ones.  But this becomes  easy to do  if the monoid has an #operation  'reverse', which has the property that  'a' is a left divisor of #'b'  if and only if  'reverse(a)' is a right  divisor of 'reverse(b)'. This #holds  for Artin-Tits  and dual  braid monoids;  Artin-Tits monoids  have a #reverse  operation which consists of reversing a word, written as a list of #atoms.  The dual monoid  also has a  reverse operation defined  in the same #way,  but this operation changes  monoid: it goes from  the dual monoid for #the  Coxeter element w to the dual  monoid for the Coxeter element w⁻¹. #The  operations 'RightLcm' and  'RightGcd', as well  quite a few algorithms #have faster implementations if the monoid has a reverse operation.\n\nThis module implements functions to solve the conjugacy problem and compute centralizers  in Garside groups, following the work of Franco, Gebhardt and Gonzalez-Meneses.\n\nTwo  elements w and w' of a monoid  M are conjugate in M if there exists  x∈ M such that wx=xw'; if  M satisfies the Öre conditions, it has  a  group  of  fractions  where  this  becomes  x⁻¹wx=w',  the  usual definition  of conjugacy. A special case  which is even closer to conjugacy in  the group is if there exists y∈  M such that w=xy and w'=yx. This relation  is not transitive in general,  but we call cyclic conjugacy the transitive closure of this relation, a restricted form of conjugacy.\n\nThe  next  observation  is  that  if  w,w'  are conjugate in the group of fractions  of the Garside monoid M then  they are conjugate in M, since if  wx=xw' then  there is  a power  Δⁱ which  is central and such that xΔⁱ∈ M. Then wxΔⁱ=xΔⁱ w' is a conjugation in M.\n\nThe  crucial observation for solving the  conjugacy problem is to introduce inf(w):=sup{i such  that  Δⁱ   divides  w}  and sup(w):=inf{i such  that  w  divides Δⁱ}, and to notice  that the number of  conjugates of w with  same inf and sup as w  is finite. Further, a  theorem of Birman shows  that the maximum inf and  minimum sup in a conjugacy class can be achieved simultaneously; the elements  achieving this are called the super summit set of w. Thus a way to  determine if two elements are conjugate  is to find a representative of both  of them in  their super summit  set, and then  solve conjugacy within that  set. This can also be used  to compute the centralizer of an element: if  we consider  the super  summit set  as the  objects of a category whose morphisms are the conjugations by simple elements, the centralizer is given by the endomorphisms of the given object.\n\nWe illustrate this on an example:\n\njulia> b=B(2,1,4,1,4)\n214.14\n\njulia> c=B(1,4,1,4,3)\n14.143\n\njulia> d=representative_operation(b,c)\n(1)⁻¹21321432\n\njulia> b^d\n14.143\n\njulia> centralizer_generators(b)\n3-element Array{Gapjm.Garside.GarsideElm{Perm{Int16},BraidMonoid{Perm{Int16},FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}},1}:\n 21.1         \n 321432.213243\n 4\n\njulia> C=conjcat(b;ss=:ss)\ncategory with 10 objects and 32 generating maps\n\njulia> C.obj\n10-element Array{Gapjm.Garside.GarsideElm{Perm{Int16},BraidMonoid{Perm{Int16},FiniteCoxeterGroup{Perm{Int16},Int64}}},1}:\n 1214.4\n 214.14\n 124.24\n 1343.1\n 14.124\n 143.13\n 24.214\n 134.14\n 13.134\n 14.143\n\nThere  is a faster  solution to the  conjugacy problem given in [gebgon10]: for  each b∈ M, they define a  particular simple left divisor of b, its preferred  prefix  such  that  the  operation  sliding which cyclically conjugates  b by  its preferred  prefix, is  eventually periodic, and the period  is contained in the super summit set  of x. We say that x is in its  sliding circuit if some  iterated sliding of x  is equal to x. The set  of sliding  circuits in  a given  conjugacy class  is smaller than the super  summit  set,  thus  allows  to  solve  the conjugacy problem faster.

For each irreducible  group the character  table is either  computed using recursive formulas  for the infinite series,  or read into the  system from a library file  for the  exceptional types.  Thus, character  tables can  be obtained quickly  even for very large groups  (e.g., E₈). Similar remarks apply for conjugacy classes.\n\nThe  conjugacy  classes  and  irreducible  characters of irreducible finite complex reflection groups have canonical labelings by certain combinatorial objects;  these labelings are used in the  tables we give.

The valuation  and degree of these give  two  integers  b,B  for  each  irreducible  character  of  W (see charinf(W)[:b]  and  charinfo(W)[:B]).  For  finite Coxeter groups, the valuation  and degree of  the generic degrees  of the one-parameter generic Hecke  algebra  give  two  more  integers  a,A (see charinfo(W)[:a] and charinfo(W)[:A],  and [@Car85, Ch.11] for  more details). These will also be  used in the operations of truncated inductions explained in the chapter \"Reflection subgroups\".\n\nIwahori-Hecke  algebras and  cyclotomic Hecke  algebras also have character tables, see the corresponding chapters.\n\nWe  now describe for each type our conventions for labeling the classes and characters.\n\nType  Aₙ (n≥0). In this  case we have  W ≅ 𝔖ₙ₊₁. The classes and characters  are labeled by partitions of n+1. The partition corresponding to  a class describes  the cycle type  for the elements  in that class; the representative   in  '.classtext'   is  the   concatenation  of  the  words corresponding  to each part, and to a part i is associated the product of i-1  consecutive generators (starting one  higher that the last generator used  for the previous  parts). The partition  corresponding to a character describes  the type of  the Young subgroup  such that the trivial character induced  from this  subgroup contains  that character with multiplicity 1 and such that every other character occurring in this induced character has a  higher a-value. Thus, the sign  character corresponds to the partition (1ⁿ⁺¹)  and  the  trivial  character  to  the  partition  (n+1). The character of the reflection representation of W is labeled by (n,1).\n\nType  Bₙ (n≥2). In this  case W=W(Bₙ) is  isomorphic to the wreath product  of the cyclic  group of order  2 with the  symmetric group 𝔖ₙ. Hence  the classes and characters are  parameterized by pairs of partitions such  that the total sum of their  parts equals n. The pair corresponding to  a class describes the signed cycle type for the elements in that class, as  in [@Car72]. We use the convention that  if (λ,μ) is such a pair then λ  corresponds  to  the  positive  and  μ to the negative cycles. Thus, (1ⁿ,-)  and (-,1ⁿ) label the trivial class and the class containing the longest  element, respectively.  The pair  corresponding to  an irreducible character is determined via Clifford theory, as follows.\n\nWe  have a semidirect product decomposition W(Bₙ)=N ⋊ 𝔖ₙ where N is the standard  n-dimensional  𝔽₂ⁿ-vector  space.  For  a,b  ≥  0 such that n=a+b let η_{a,b} be the irreducible character of N which takes value 1  on the first a standard basis vectors and value -1 on the next b standard  basis vectors of N. Then  the inertia subgroup of η_{a,b} has the  form T_{a,b}=N.(𝔖_a × 𝔖_b) and  we can extend η_{a,b} trivially to an  irreducible  character  η̃_{a,b}  of  T_{a,b}.  Let  α and β be partitions  of a and b, respectively. We take the tensor product of the corresponding  irreducible characters of 𝔖_a and 𝔖_b and regard this as an  irreducible  character  of  T_{a,b}.  Multiplying this character with η̃_{a,b}  and  inducing  to  W(Bₙ)  yields an irreducible character χ= χ_{(α,β)}  of W(Bₙ). This defines the correspondence between irreducible characters and pairs of partitions as above.\n\nFor example, the pair ((n),-) labels the trivial character and (-,(1ⁿ)) labels  the  sign  character.  The  character  of  the  natural  reflection representation is labeled by ((n-1),(1)).\n\nType  Dₙ (n≥4). In this case W=W(Dₙ) can be embedded as a subgroup of index  2 into the Coxeter  group W(Bₙ). The intersection  of a class of W(Bₙ) with W(Dₙ) is either empty or a single class in W(Dₙ) or splits up  into two classes in  W(Dₙ). This also leads  to a parameterization of the  classes of W(Dₙ) by pairs of  partitions (λ,μ) as before but where the  number of parts of μ is even and where there are two classes of this type  if μ is empty and all parts of  λ are even. In the latter case we denote  the two classes in W(Dₙ) by (λ,+) and (λ,-), where we use the convention  that  the  class  labeled  by (λ,+) contains a representative which  can be written  as a word  in {s₁,s₃,…,sₙ} and  (λ,-) contains a representative which can be written as a word in {s₂,s₃, …,sₙ}.\n\nBy  Clifford theory the restriction of  an irreducible character of W(Bₙ) to  W(Dₙ)  is  either  irreducible  or  splits  up  into  two irreducible components.  Let (α,β) be  a pair of  partitions with total  sum of parts equal to n. If α!=β then the restrictions of the irreducible characters of  W(Bₙ) labeled  by (α,β)  and (β,α)  are irreducible and equal. If α=β  then the restriction of the character labeled by (α,α) splits into two  irreducible components  which we  denote by  (α,+) and (α,-). Note that  this can only happen if n is  even. In order to fix the notation we use  a result of  [@Ste89] which describes  the value of  the difference of these  two  characters  on  a  class  of  the  form (λ,+) in terms of the character  values  of  the  symmetric  group  𝔖_{n/2}.  Recall that it is implicit  in the notation (λ,+) that all  parts of λ are even. Let λ' be  the partition of n/2 obtained by  dividing each part by 2. Then the value  of χ_{(α,-)}-χ_{(α,+)} on an element in the class (λ,+) is given by  2^{k(λ)} times  the value  of the  irreducible character of 𝔖_{n/2} labeled  by α on the class of  cycle type λ'. (Here, k(λ) denotes the number of non-zero parts of λ.)\n\nThe  labels for the trivial, the  sign and the natural reflection character are the same as for W(Bₙ), since these characters are restrictions of the corresponding characters of W(Bₙ).\n\nThe groups G(d,1,n). They  are isomorphic to the wreath product of the cyclic group of order d with  the  symmetric  group  𝔖ₙ.  Hence  the  classes  and characters are parameterized  by d-tuples of partitions such that the total sum of their parts  equals n. The words chosen  as representatives of the classes are, when d>2, computed in a slightly different way than for Bₙ, in order to agree  with the words on which Ram  and Halverson compute the characters of the  Hecke algebra. First the parts of the d partitions are merged in one big  partition and sorted in  increasing order. Then, to  a part i coming from  the j-th partition is  associated the word (l+1…1… l+1)ʲ⁻¹l+2…l+i where l is the highest generator used to express the previous part.\n\nThe  d-tuple corresponding to an  irreducible character is determined via Clifford  theory in  a similar  way than  for the  Bₙ case.  The identity character  has the first  partition with one  part equal n  and the other ones  empty. The character of the  reflection representations has the first two  partitions with one part  equal respectively to n-1  and to 1, and the other partitions empty.\n\nThe groups G(de,e,n). They  are normal  subgroups of  index e  in G(de,1,n).  The quotient is cyclic,  generated by the image g  of the first generator of G(de,1,n). The  classes are parameterized as the  classes of G(de,e,n) with an extra information for a component of a class which splits.\n\nAccording  to  [@Hu85],  a  class  C  of  G(de,1,n)  parameterized by a de-partition  (S₀,…,S_{de-1}) is  in G(de,e,n)  if e  divides ∑ᵢ i ∑_{p∈  Sᵢ}p. It splits in d classes for the largest d dividing e and all  parts of all Sᵢ and  such that Sᵢ is empty  if d does not divide i.  If w is in C then 'gⁱ w g⁻ⁱ' for 'i in 0:d-1' are representatives of  the  classes  of  G(de,e,n)  which  meet  C.  They are described by appending the integer i to the label for C.\n\nThe  characters are described by Clifford theory. We make g act on labels for  characters of G(de,1,n)  . The action  of g permutes circularly by d  the partitions in the de-tuple.  A character has same restriction to G(de,e,n)  as its transform by g.  The number of irreducible components of its restriction is equal to the order k of its stabilizer under powers of  g.  We  encode  a  character  of  G(de,e,n)  by first, choosing the smallest  for lexicographical order label  of a character whose restriction contains  it; then this label is periodic with a motive repeated k times; we  represent the  character by  one of  these motives,  to which we append E(k)ⁱ for 'i in 0:k-1' to describe which component of the restriction we choose.\n\nTypes  G₂ and F₄. The matrices  of character values and the orderings and  labelings of  the irreducible  characters are  exactly the  same as in [@Car85,  p.412/413]: in type G₂ the character φ₁,₃' takes the value -1 on  the reflection associated  to the long  simple root; in  type F₄, the characters  φ₁,₁₂', φ₂,₄', φ₄,₇', φ₈,₉' and φ₉,₆' occur in the induced  of the  identity from  the A₂  corresponding to the short simple roots;  the  pairs  (φ₂,₁₆',  φ₂,₄″)  and  (φ₈,₃', φ₈,₉″) are related by tensoring by sign; and finally φ₆,₆″ is the exterior square of  the reflection representation. Note, however, that we put the long root at the left of the Dynkin diagrams to be in accordance with the conventions in [@Lus85, (4.8) and (4.10)].\n\nThe  classes  are  labeled  by  Carter's  admissible  diagrams  [@Car72]. A character is labeled by a pair (d,b) where d denotes the degree and b the  corresponding b-invariant. If there  are several characters with the same pair (d,b) we attach a prime to them, as in [@Car85].\n\nTypes  E₆,E₇,E₈. The character tables are obtained by specialization of those  of the Hecke algebra. The classes are labeled by Carter's admissible diagrams  [@Car72]. A  character is  labeled by  the pair (d,b) where d denotes  the degree and  b is the  corresponding b-invariant. For these types, this gives a unique labeling of the characters.\n\nNon-crystallographic  types I₂(m), H₃, H₄. In these cases we do not have  canonical  labelings  for  the  classes.  We  label  them  by reduced expressions.\n\nEach  character for  type H₃  is uniquely  determined by the pair (d,b) where  d is the degree and  b the corresponding b-invariant. For type H₄  there are just  two characters (those  of degree 30)  for which the corresponding  pairs are  the same.  These two  characters are nevertheless distinguished  by  their  fake  degrees:  the  character φ₃₀,₁₀' has fake degree  q¹⁰+q¹²+ higher terms, while φ₃₀,₁₀″ has fake degree q¹⁰+q¹⁴+ higher  terms. The characters in the table for type H₄ are ordered in the same way as in [@AL82].\n\nFinally,  the characters  of degree 2  for type  I₂(m) are  ordered as follows.  The matrix representations affording the characters of degree 2 are given by: ρ_j : s₁s₂ ↦ (\\begin{array}{cc}E(m)^j&0\\0&E(m)^{-j}\\end{array}),  s₁↦(\\begin{array}{cc}0&1\\1&0\\end{array}), where  1 ≤ j ≤  ⌊(m-1)/2⌋. The reflection representation is  ρ₁. The  characters in  the table  are ordered by listing first the characters of degree 1 and then ρ₁,ρ₂,….\n\nPrimitive complex reflection groups G₄ to G₃₄. The  groups G₂₃=H₃, G₂₈=F₄, G₃₀=H₄ are exceptional Coxeter groups and have  been  explained  above.  Similarly  for  the  other groups labels for characters  consist primarily  of the  pair (d,b)  where d  denotes the degree  and b is the corresponding  b-invariant. This is sufficient for G₄,  G₁₂, G₂₂ and G₂₄. For other  groups there are pairs or triples of  characters which  have the  same (d,b)  value. We  disambiguate these according  to  the  conventions  of  [@Mal00]  for G₂₇, G₂₉, G₃₁, G₃₃ and G₃₄:\n\nFor G₂₇:\n\nThe  fake degree  of φ₃,₅'  (resp. φ₃,₂₀',  φ₈,₉″) has smaller degree that  of  φ₃,₅″  (resp.  φ₃,₂₀″,  φ₈,₉'). The characters φ₅,₁₅' and φ₅,₆' occur with multiplicity 1 in the induced from the trivial character of  the parabolic subgroup  of type A₂  generated by the  first and third generator  (it is  asserted mistakenly  in [@Mal00]  that φ₅,₆″  does not occur in this induced; it occurs with multiplicity 2).\n\nFor G₂₉:\n\nThe  character  φ₆,₁₀‴  is  the  exterior  square  of φ₄,₁; its complex conjugate  is φ₆,₁₀⁗. The  character φ₁₅,₄″ occurs  in φ₄,₁⊗φ₄,₃; the character  φ₁₅,₁₂″  is  tensored  by  the  sign  character from φ₁₅,₄″. Finally  φ₆,₁₀' occurs in  the induced from  the trivial character of the standard parabolic subgroup of type A₃ generated by the first, second and fourth generators.\n\nFor G₃₁:\n\nThe  characters φ₁₅,₈', φ₁₅,₂₀' and φ₄₅,₈″ occur in φ₄,₁⊗φ₂₀,₇; the character   φ₂₀,₁₃'  is  complex  conjugate  of  φ₂₀,₇;  the  character φ₄₅,₁₂'  is tensored by sign of φ₄₅,₈'. The two terms of maximal degree of  the fakedegree of φ₃₀,₁₀' are  q⁵⁰+q⁴⁶ while for φ₃₀,₁₀″ they are q⁵⁰+2q⁴⁶.\n\nFor G₃₃:\n\nThe  terms of  maximal degree  of the  fakedegree of φ₁₀,₈' are q²⁸+q²⁶ while  for φ₁₀,₈' they are q²⁸+q²⁴. The  terms of maximal degree of the fakedegree   of  φ₄₀,₅'  are  q³¹+q²⁹   while  for  φ₄₀,₅″  they  are q³¹+2q²⁹.  The character  φ₁₀,₁₇' is  tensored by  sign of φ₁₀,₈' and φ₄₀,₁₄' is tensored by sign of φ₄₀,₅'.\n\nFor G₃₄:\n\nThe  character φ₂₀,₃₃' occurs in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₅,₁₄. The character φ₇₀,₉' is rational.  The character  φ₇₀,₉″ occurs  in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₅,₁₄.  The character φ₇₀,₄₅'   is  rational.The   character  φ₇₀,₄₅″   is  tensored  by  the determinant  character of  φ₇₀,₉″. The  character φ₅₆₀,₁₈' is rational. The character φ₅₆₀,₁₈‴ occurs in φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇. The character φ₂₈₀,₁₂' occurs    in   φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇.   The   character   φ₂₈₀,₃₀″   occurs   in φ₆,₁⊗φ₃₃₆,₁₇.  The  character  φ₅₄₀,₂₁'  occurs  in φ₆,₁⊗φ₁₀₅,₂₀. The character  φ₁₀₅,₈' is  complex conjugate  of φ₁₀₅,₄,  and φ₈₄₀,₁₃' is complex  conjugate  of  φ₈₄₀,₁₁.  The  character  φ₈₄₀,₂₃'  is  complex conjugate  of  φ₈₄₀,₁₉.  Finally  φ₁₂₀,₂₁'  occurs  in induced from the trivial character of the standard parabolic subgroup of type A₅ generated by the generators of G₃₄ with the third one omitted.\n\nFor  the groups G₅ and G₇ we  adopt the following conventions. For G₅ they are compatible with those of [@MR03] and [@BMM14].\n\nFor G₅:\n\nWe  let W=ComplexReflectionGroup(5),  so the  generators are  W(1) and W(2).\n\nThe  character φ₁,₄' (resp. φ₁,₁₂', φ₂,₃') takes the value 1 (resp. ζ₃,  -ζ₃)  on  W(1).  The  character  φ₁,₈″ is complex conjugate to φ₁,₁₆,  and the character  φ₁,₈' is complex  conjugate to φ₁,₄' . The character  φ₂,₅″ is complex  conjugate to φ₂,₁;  φ₂,₅' take the value -1 on W(1). The character φ₂,₇' is complex conjugate to φ₂,₅'.\n\nFor G₇:\n\nWe  let W=ComplexReflectionGroup(7),  so the  generators are W(1), W(2) and W(3).\n\nThe  characters  φ₁,₄'  and  φ₁,₁₀'  take  the value 1 on W(2). The character  φ₁,₈″ is complex  conjugate to φ₁,₁₆  and φ₁,₈' is complex conjugate  to φ₁,₄'. The characters φ₁,₁₂'  and φ₁,₁₈' take the value ζ₃  on W(2). The character φ₁,₁₄″ is complex conjugate to φ₁,₂₂ and φ₁,₁₄'  is complex conjugate to φ₁,₁₀'. The character φ₂,₃' takes the value  -ζ₃ on  W(2) and  φ₂,₁₃' takes  the value  -1 on W(2). The characters  φ₂,₁₁″, φ₂,₅″, φ₂,₇‴ and  φ₂,₁ are Galois conjugate, as well  as  the  characters  φ₂,₇',  φ₂,₁₃',  φ₂,₁₁'  and  φ₂,₅'. The character  φ₂,₉' is complex  conjugate to φ₂,₁₅  and φ₂,₉‴ is complex conjugate to φ₂,₃'.\n\nFinally,  for the remaining groups G₆, G₈  to G₁₁, G₁₃ to G₂₁, G₂₅, G₂₆,  G₃₂ and G₃₃ there are only  pairs of characters with same value (d,b).  We give labels uniformly to these characters by applying in order the following rules :\n\nIf the two characters have  different fake degrees, label φ_{d,b}' the  one  whose  fake  degree  is  minimal  for  the  lexicographic  order of  polynomials (starting with the highest term).\nFor the not yet labeled pairs, if only one of the two characters has the  property   that  in  its   Galois  orbit  at   least  one  character  is  distinguished by its (d,b)-invariant, label it φ_{d,b}'.\nFor the not yet labeled pairs,  if the minimum of the (d,b)-value (for  the  lexicographic  order  (d,b))  in  the  Galois  orbits  of the two  character  is different, label φ_{d,b}' the character with the minimal  minimum.\nWe define now a new invariant  for characters: consider all the pairs of  irreducible   characters  χ  and  ψ  uniquely  determined  by  their  (d,b)-invariant such that φ occurs with non-zero multiplicity m in  χ⊗ψ.  We define  t(φ) to  be the  minimal (for  lexicographic order)  possible list (d(χ),b(χ),d(ψ),b(ψ),m).\n\nFor  the not  yet labeled  pairs, if  the t-invariants are different, label φ_{d,b}' the character with the minimal t-invariant.\n\nAfter  applying  the  last  rule  all  the  pairs  will be labelled for the considered  groups. The labelling obtained  is compatible for G₂₅, G₂₆, G₃₂  and G₃₃ with that of [@Mal00]  and for G₈ with that described in [@MR03].\n\nWe  should  emphasize  that  for  all  groups  with  a  few exceptions, the parameters  for characters do  not depend on  any non-canonical choice. The exceptions  are G(de,e,n) with e>1, and G₅, G₇, G₂₇, G₂₈, G₂₉ and  G₃₄, groups  which admit  outer automorphisms  preserving the set of reflections,  so choices  of a  particular value  on a particular generator must be made for characters which are not invariant by these automorphisms.\n\nLabels  for the classes. For the exceptional complex reflection groups, the labels  for the classes represent the  decomposition of a representative of the  class as a product of generators, with the additional conventions that 'z'  represents the generator  of the center  and for well-generated groups 'c'  represents a Coxeter element  (a product of the  generators which is a regular element for the highest reflection degree).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Gapjm.Chars.CharTable","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Gapjm.Chars.CharTable","text":"CharTable is a structure to hold character tables of groups and Hecke  algebras\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#Gapjm.Chars.charinfo","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Gapjm.Chars.charinfo","text":"charinfo(W)\n\nreturns   information  about  the  irreducible  characters  of  the  finite reflection group W.

We say that F₀∈ GL(V)  is an  automorphism of  R if  it permutes  R and is of finite order  (finite  order  is  automatic  if  R generates V). It follows by cite[chap.  VI, S1.1, lemme 1]{Bou68} that  the dual F₀*∈ GL(V*) permutes the  coroots  R*⊂  V*;  thus  F₀  normalizes  the  reflection group W associated  to R, that is w↦ F₀wF₀⁻¹ is an automorphism of W. Thus we get a reflection coset WF₀, which we call a Coxeter coset.\n\nThe  motivation for introducing Coxeter  cosets comes from automorphisms of algebraic  reductive groups, giving rise to non-split reductive groups over finite fields. Let 𝐆 be a connected reductive algebraic group 𝐆 over an algebraic  closure 𝔽̄_q of a finite field 𝔽_q, defined over 𝔽_q; this corresponds  to a  Frobenius endomorphism  F so  that the finite group of rational  points 𝐆(𝔽_q) identifies to the  subgroup 𝐆^F of fixed points under F.\n\nLet 𝐓 be a maximal torus of 𝐆, and Φ (resp. Φ*) be the roots (resp. coroots)  of 𝐆 with respect  to 𝐓 in the  character group X(𝐓) (resp. the  group of one-parameter subgroups Y(𝐓)). Then 𝐆 is determined up to isomorphism  by (X(𝐓),Φ,Y(𝐓),Φ*); this corresponds  to give a root system in   the  vector  space  V=ℚ ⊗ X(𝐓)   and  a  rational  reflection  group W=N_𝐆(𝐓)/𝐓 acting on it.\n\nIf  𝐓 is F-stable the Frobenius endomorphism F acts also naturally on X(T)  and defines thus  an endomorphism of  V, which is  of the form q F₀, where F₀∈ GL(V) is of finite order and normalizes W. We get thus a Coxeter  coset WF₀⊂GL(V).  The data  (X(𝐓), Φ,  Y(𝐓), Φ*,  F₀), and the integer   q  completely  determine  up   to  isomorphism  the  associated reductive finite group 𝐆^F. Thus these data is a way of representing in the  essential  information  which  determines  a  finite  reductive group. Indeed, all properties of Chevalley groups can be computed from that datum: symbols  representing characters, conjugacy classes,  and finally the whole character table of 𝐆^F.\n\nIt  turns out that  many interesting objects  attached to this datum depend only on (V,W, F₀): the order of the maximal tori, the fake degrees, the order  of 𝐆^F, symbols representing unipotent characters, Deligne-Lusztig induction  in  terms  of  almost  characters, the Fourier matrix relating characters  and almost  characters, etc…  (see, e.g.,  cite{BMM93}). It is thus  possible to extend their  construction to non-crystallographic groups (or  even to more general complex  reflection groups, see \"Spets\"); this is why  we did  not include  a root  system in  the definition of a reflection coset. However, unipotent conjugacy classes for instance depend on the root system.\n\nWe assume now that 𝐓 is contained in an F-stable Borel subgroup of 𝐆. This  defines an order  on the roots,  and there is  a unique element ϕ∈ W F₀,  the  reduced  element  of  the  coset,  which  preserves the set of positive  roots.  It  thus  defines  a  diagram  automorphism, that is an automorphism  of the Coxeter system (W,S).  This element is stored in the component  '.phi' of the coset record. It may be defined without mentioning the  roots,  as  follows:  (W,F₀(S))  is  another  Coxeter  system,  thus conjugate to S by a unique element of W, thus there is a unique element ϕ∈ WF₀ which stabilizes S (a proof follows from cite[Theoreme 1, chap. V,  S  3]{Bou68}).  We  consider  thus  cosets  of the form Wϕ where ϕ stabilizes  S. The coset  W ϕ is  completely defined by the permutation '.phi'  when 𝐆 is semi-simple –- equivalently when Φ generates V; in this case we just need to specify 'phi' to define the coset.\n\nThere is a slight generalisation of the above setup, covering in particular the  case of the Ree  and Suzuki groups. We  consider 𝐆^F where F not a Frobenius  endomorphism, but  an isogeny  such that  some power  F^n is a Frobenius endomorphism. Then F still defines an endomorphism of V which normalizes  W; we define a real number q such that F^n is attached to an  𝔽_{qⁿ}-structure. Then we still have F=q F₀ where F₀ is of finite order  but q is no more an integer.  Thus F₀∈ GL(V⊗ ℝ) but F₀∉ GL(V). For  instance, for the  Ree and Suzuki  groups, F₀ is  an automorphism of order  2 of W, which is of type G₂, B₂ or F₄, and q=√2 for B₂ and  F₄ and q=√3  for G₂ This  can be constructed  starting from root systems  for G₂, B₂ or  F₄ where all the  roots have the same length. This kind of root system is not crystallographic. Such non-crystallographic  root systems exist for all finite Coxeter groups such as  the dihedral groups, H₃ and H₄. We will call here Weyl cosets the cosets  corresponding to rational forms  of algebraic groups, which include thus some non-rational roots systems for B₂, G₂ and F₄.\n\nConjugacy  classes and irreducible characters of Coxeter cosets are defined as  for  general  reflection  cosets.  For  irreducible  characters of Weyl cosets,  we choose (following Lusztig) for each ϕ-stable character of W a  particular extension to a character of  W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩, which we will call the preferred extension. The character table of the coset Wϕ is the table of  the restrictions to  Wϕ of the  preferred extensions. The question of finding the conjugacy classes and character table of a Coxeter coset can be reduced to the case of irreducible root systems R.\n\nThe automorphism ϕ permutes the irreducible components of W, and Wϕ  is a direct  product of cosets  where ϕ permutes cyclically the irreducible components of W. The preferred extension is defined to be the  direct  product  of  the  preferred  extension  in  each  of these situations.\nAssume now that Wϕ is a  descent of scalars, that is the decomposition in irreducible components W=W₁× ⋯ × Wₖ is cyclically permuted by ϕ. Then there are natural bijections from the ϕ-conjugacy classes of W to  the ϕᵏ-conjugacy classes  of W₁ as  well as from the ϕ-stable characters  of W to the ϕᵏ-stable  characters of W₁, which reduce the  definition of preferred  extensions on Wϕ  to the definition for W₁ϕᵏ.\nAssume now  that W  is the  Coxeter group  of an  irreducible root system.   ϕ  permutes  the  simple   roots,  hence  induces  a  graph automorphism  on  the  corresponding  Dynkin  diagram.  If  ϕ=1  then conjugacy  classes and  characters coincide  with those  of the Coxeter group W.\n\nThe  nontrivial cases for crystallographic roots  systems are (the order of ϕ  is written as left exponent to  the type): ²Aₙ, ²Dₙ, ³D₄, ²E₆. For  non-crystallographic root  systems where  all the  roots have the same length the additional cases ²B₂, ²G₂, ²F₄ and ²I₂(k) arise.\n\nIn  case  ³D₄  the  group  W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩  can be embedded into the Coxeter  group of type F₄, which induces a labeling for the conjugacy classes of the coset. The preferred extension is chosen as the (single) extension with rational values.\nIn case  ²Dₙ the  group W⋊ ⟨ϕ⟩  is isomorphic  to a Coxeter group of type Bₙ. This induces a canonical labeling for the conjugacy classes  of the coset and allows to define the preferred extension in a combinatorial  way  using  the  labels  (pairs  of  partitions) for the characters of the Coxeter group of type Bₙ.\nIn the remaining crystallographic cases ϕ identifies to -w₀ where w₀  is the longest element of W.  So, there is a canonical labeling of  the conjugacy classes and characters of  the coset by those of W. The  preferred extensions  are defined  by describing  the signs of the character values on -w₀.\n\nThe  most general  construction of  a Coxeter  coset is  by starting from a Coxeter   datum   specified   by   the   matrices   of   'simpleRoots'  and 'simpleCoroots',  and  giving  in  addition  the  matrix 'F0Mat' of the map F₀:V→ V (see the commands  'CoxeterCoset' and 'CoxeterSubCoset'). As for Coxeter  groups,  the  elements  of  Wϕ  are  uniquely  determined by the permutation  they  induce  on  the  set  of  roots  R.  We consider these permutations as 'Elements' of the Coxeter coset.\n\nCoxeter  cosets are implemented by a struct which points to a Coxeter datum record  and  has  additional  fields  holding 'F0Mat' and the corresponding element  'phi'. Functions on the coset (for example, 'classinfo') are about properties  of  the  group  coset  W  ϕ  ;  however, most definitions for elements of untwisted Coxeter groups apply without change to elements in W ϕ:  e.g., if we define the length of  an element wϕ∈ Wϕ as the number of positive  roots it sends to negative ones, it  is the same as the length of w,  i.e., ϕ is of length 0, since ϕ has been chosen to preserve the set of positive roots. Similarly, the 'Coxeter word' describing wϕ is the same as the one for w, etc…\n\nWe associate to a Coxeter coset Wϕ a twisted Dynkin diagram, consisting of  the Dynkin diagram of W and  the graph automorphism induced by ϕ on this  diagram (this specifies the  group W⋊ ⟨F⟩, mentioned above, up to  isomorphism). See the  functions 'ReflectionType', 'ReflectionName' and 'Diagram' for Coxeter cosets.\n\nBelow  is an example showing first how to not define, then how to define, the Weyl coset for a Suzuki group:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:B,2)\nB₂\n\njulia> spets(W,Perm(1,2))\nERROR: matrix F must preserve the roots\nStacktrace:\n [1] error(::String) at ./error.jl:33\n [2] spets(::Gapjm.Weyl.FCG{Int16,Int64,PRG{Int64,Int16}}, ::Array{Int64,2}) at /home/jmichel/julia/Gapjm/src/Cosets.jl:241 (repeats 2 times)\n [3] top-level scope at REPL[19]:1\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:Bsym,2)\nBsym₂\n\njulia> spets(W,Perm(1,2))\n²Bsym₂\n\njulia> CharTable(W)\nCharTable(H(G(2,1,2)))\n   │11. 1.1 .11 2. .2\n───┼──────────────────\n11.│  1   1   1 -1 -1\n1.1│  2   .  -2  .  .\n.11│  1  -1   1 -1  1\n2. │  1   1   1  1  1\n.2 │  1  -1   1  1 -1\n\nA subcoset Hwϕ of Wϕ is given by a reflection subgroup H of W and an  element w of W  such that wϕ induces  an automorphism of the root system of H.

This  variety has a natural action of 𝐆 ^F on the left, so the corresponding Deligne-Lusztig virtual module  ∑ᵢ  (-1)ⁱ  Hⁱ_c(X_𝐁,ℚ̄_ℓ)  also.  The  character of this virtual module  is  the  Deligne-Lusztig  character  R_𝐓^𝐆  (1);  the  notation reflects the fact that one can prove that this character does not depend on the  choice  of  𝐁.  Actually,  this  character  is  parameterized  by an F-conjugacy  class of W: if 𝐓₀⊂𝐁₀ is  an F-stable pair, there is an unique w∈ W=N_𝐆(𝐓₀)/𝐓₀ such that the triple (𝐓,𝐁,F) is 𝐆-conjugate to (𝐓₀,𝐁₀,wF).  In this case we denote R_w for R_𝐓^𝐆(1); it depends only on the F-class of w.\n\nThe unipotent characters of 𝐆^F are the irreducible constituents of the R_w. In a similar way that the unipotent classes are a building block for describing  the  conjugacy  classes  of  a  reductive  group, the unipotent characters  are  a  building  block  for  the  irreducible  characters of a reductive  group.  They  can  be  parameterized  by combinatorial data that Lusztig  has attached just to the coset Wφ, where φ is the finite order automorphism  of  X(𝐓₀)  such  that  F=qφ.  Thus, from the viewpoint of Chevie, they are objects combinatorially attached to a Coxeter coset.\n\nA  subset  of  the  unipotent  characters, the principal series unipotent characters,   can  be  described  in  an   elementary  way.  They  are  the constituents of R₁, or equivalently the characters of the virtual module defined  by  the  cohomology  of  X_{𝐁₀},  which  is the discrete variety (𝐆/𝐁₀)^F; the virtual module reduces to the actual module ℚ̄_ℓ[(𝐆/𝐁₀)^F].  Thus the Deligne-Lusztig induction R_𝐓₀^𝐆(1) reduces to  Harish-Chandra induction,  defined as  follows: let  𝐏 =𝐔  ⋊ 𝐋  be an F-stable  Levi decomposition of an  F-stable parabolic subgroup of 𝐆. Then  the Harish-Chandra induced  R_𝐋^𝐆 of a  character χ of 𝐋^F is the  character Ind_{𝐏^F}^{𝐆^F}χ̃, where χ̃ is  the lift to 𝐏^F of χ via  the quotient  𝐏^F/𝐔^F=𝐋^F; Harish-Chandra  induction is a particular case  of Lusztig induction,  which is defined  when 𝐏 is not F-stable using  the  variety  X_𝐔={  g𝐔∈𝐆/𝐔  ∣  g𝐔∩  F(g𝐔)≠∅},  and  gives  for an 𝐋^F-module   a  virtual  𝐆^F-module.  Like  ordinary  induction,  these functors  have  adjoint  functors  going  from  representations of 𝐆^F to representations   (resp.   virtual   representations)   of   𝐋^F   called Harish-Chandra restriction (resp. Lusztig restriction).\n\nThe  commuting  algebra  of  𝐆^F-endomorphisms  of  R_{𝐓₀}^𝐆(1)  is  an Iwahori-Hecke  algebra for W^φ, with parameters  which are some powers of q;  they  are  all  equal  to  q  when  W^φ=W.  Thus principal series unipotent characters correspond to characters of W^φ.\n\nTo  understand the  decomposition of  Deligne-Lusztig characters,  and thus unipotent  characters,  is  is  useful  to  introduce  another set of class functions  which are parameterized  by irreducible characters  of the coset Wφ.  If  χ  is  such  a  character,  we  define  the associated almost character by: Rᵪ=|W|⁻¹∑_{w∈ W}χ(wφ) R_w. The reason to the name is that these  class  function  are  close  to irreducible characters: they satisfy ⟨Rᵪ, R_ψ⟩_{𝐆^F}=δ_{χ,ψ};  for  the  linear  and  unitary group they are actually  unipotent characters (up to sign in the latter case). They are in general  sum (with  rational coefficients)  of a  small number of unipotent characters  in  the  same  Lusztig  family  (see  \"Families  of unipotent characters\").  The degree of Rᵪ is a polynomial in q equal to the fake degree  of  the  character  χ  of  Wφ  (see  \"Functions  for Reflection cosets\").\n\nWe  now describe the parameterization of unipotent characters when W^φ=W, thus  when the coset Wφ identifies with W (the situation is similar but a  bit more difficult to describe  in general). The (rectangular) matrix of scalar  products  ⟨ρ, Rᵪ⟩_{𝐆 ^F},  when  characters of W and unipotent characters  are arranged in the right  order, is block-diagonal with rather small blocks which are called Lusztig families.\n\nFor  the characters of W a family 𝓕 corresponds to a block of the Hecke algebra  over a ring called the Rouquier  ring. To 𝓕 Lusztig associates a small  group Γ (not bigger  than (ℤ/2)^n, or 𝔖ᵢ  for i≤5) such that the  unipotent  characters  in  the  family  are parameterized by the pairs (x,θ)  taken up to  Γ-conjugacy, where x∈Γ  and θ is an irreducible character  of  C_Γ(x).  Further,  the  elements  of  𝓕  themselves  are parameterized  by a  subset of  such pairs,  and Lusztig  defines a pairing between  such pairs which computes the scalar product ⟨ρ, Rᵪ⟩_{𝐆^F}. For more details see \"DrinfeldDouble\".\n\nA  second parameterization  of unipotent  character is  via Harish-Chandra series.  A character is called cuspidal if all its proper Harish-Chandra restrictions  vanish. There are few  cuspidal unipotent characters (none in linear   groups,  and  at   most  one  in   other  classical  groups).  The 𝐆^F-endomorphism  algebra of an  Harish-Chandra induced R_{𝐋^F}^{𝐆^F}λ, where λ is a cuspidal unipotent character turns out to be a Hecke algebra associated to the group W_{𝐆^F}(𝐋^F):=N_{𝐆^F}(𝐋)/𝐋, which turns out to be a  Coxeter group.  Thus another  parameterization is  by triples (𝐋,λ,φ), where  λ  is  a  cuspidal  unipotent  character  of  𝐋^F  and φ is an irreducible   character  of  the   relative  group  W_{𝐆^F}(𝐋^F).  Such characters  are said to  belong to the  Harish-Chandra series determined by (𝐋,λ).\n\nA  final  piece  of  information  attached  to  unipotent characters is the eigenvalues  of Frobenius. Let F^δ be the smallest power of the isogeny F which is a split Frobenius (that is, F^δ is a Frobenius and φ^δ=1). Then  F^δ acts  naturally on  Deligne-Lusztig varieties  and thus  on the corresponding  virtual modules, and  commutes to the  action of 𝐆^F; thus for  a given  unipotent character  ρ, a  submodule of  the virtual module which  affords ρ  affords a  single eigenvalue  μ of  F^δ. Results of Lusztig  and  Digne-Michel  show  that  this  eigenvalue  is  of  the  form q^{aδ}λ_ρ where 2a∈ℤ and λ_ρ is a root of unity which depends only on ρ  and not the considered module. This  λ_ρ is called the eigenvalue of Frobenius  attached  to  ρ.  Unipotent  characters  in the Harish-Chandra series of a pair (𝐋,λ) have the same eigenvalue of Frobenius as λ.\n\nChevie   contains  tables  of  all   this  information,   and  can  compute Harish-Chandra  and Lusztig  induction of  unipotent characters  and almost characters. We illustrate the information on some examples:\n\njulia> W=coxgroup(:G,2)\nG₂\n\njulia> uc=UnipotentCharacters(W)\nUnipotentCharacters(G₂)\n      γ│      Deg(γ)  Feg Fr(γ)    label\n───────┼─────────────────────────────────\nφ₁‚₀   │           1    1     1         \nφ₁‚₆   │          q⁶   q⁶     1         \nφ′₁‚₃  │  (1/3)qΦ₃Φ₆   q³     1    (1,ρ)\nφ″₁‚₃  │  (1/3)qΦ₃Φ₆   q³     1   (g₃,1)\nφ₂‚₁   │ (1/6)qΦ₂²Φ₃  qΦ₈     1    (1,1)\nφ₂‚₂   │ (1/2)qΦ₂²Φ₆ q²Φ₄     1   (g₂,1)\nG₂[-1] │ (1/2)qΦ₁²Φ₃    0    -1   (g₂,ε)\nG₂[1]  │ (1/6)qΦ₁²Φ₆    0     1    (1,ε)\nG₂[ζ₃] │(1/3)qΦ₁²Φ₂²    0    ζ₃  (g₃,ζ₃)\nG₂[ζ₃²]│(1/3)qΦ₁²Φ₂²    0   ζ₃² (g₃,ζ₃²)\n\nThe first column gives the name of the unipotent character; the first 6 are in  the  principal  series  so  are  named  according  to the corresponding characters  of W. The last 4 are cuspidal, and named by the corresponding eigenvalue  of  Frobenius,  which  is  displayed  in  the fourth column. In general   the   names   of   the   unipotent  characters  come  from  their parameterization  by  Harish-Chandra  series;  in  addition,  for classical groups, they are associated to symbols.\n\nThe first two characters are each in a family by themselves. The last eight are  in a family associated to the group Γ=𝔖_3: the last column shows the parameters  (x,θ). The  second column  shows the  degree of the unipotent characters, which is transformed by the Lusztig Fourier matrix of the third column,  which gives the  degree of the  corresponding almost character, or equivalently the fake degree of the corresponding character of W.\n\nOne  can get  more information  on the  Lusztig Fourier  matrix of  the big family by asking\n\njulia> uc.families[1]\nFamily(D(S₃):[5, 6, 4, 3, 8, 7, 9, 10])\n   label│eigen                                               \n────────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n(1,1)   │    1 1//6  1//2  1//3  1//3  1//6  1//2  1//3  1//3\n(g₂,1)  │    1 1//2  1//2  0//1  0//1 -1//2 -1//2  0//1  0//1\n(g₃,1)  │    1 1//3  0//1  2//3 -1//3  1//3  0//1 -1//3 -1//3\n(1,ρ)   │    1 1//3  0//1 -1//3  2//3  1//3  0//1 -1//3 -1//3\n(1,ε)   │    1 1//6 -1//2  1//3  1//3  1//6 -1//2  1//3  1//3\n(g₂,ε)  │   -1 1//2 -1//2  0//1  0//1 -1//2  1//2  0//1  0//1\n(g₃,ζ₃) │   ζ₃ 1//3  0//1 -1//3 -1//3  1//3  0//1  2//3 -1//3\n(g₃,ζ₃²)│  ζ₃² 1//3  0//1 -1//3 -1//3  1//3  0//1 -1//3  2//3\n\nOne  can  do  computations  with  individual  unipotent characters.

Indecomposable  locally constant  𝐆-equivariant  sheaves  on  C,  called  local  systems, are parameterized  by irreducible characters of A(u). The ordinary Springer correspondence  is a bijection  between irreducible characters  of the Weyl group  and a large subset  of the local systems  which contains all trivial local  systems (those parameterized by the  trivial character of A(u) for each  u).  More  generally,  the  generalized  Springer  correspondence associates  to each local  system a (unique  up to 𝐆-conjugacy) cuspidal pair  of a Levi  subgroup 𝐋 of  𝐆 and a  cuspidal local system on an unipotent  class of 𝐋, such that the set of local systems associated to a given cuspidal pair is parameterized by the characters of the relative Weyl group W_𝐆(𝐋):=N_𝐆(𝐋)/𝐋. There are only few cuspidal pairs.\n\nThe  Springer correspondence gives information on the character values of a finite  reductive  groups  as  follows:  assume  that  k is the algebraic closure  of a finite field 𝔽_q and  that F is the Frobenius attached to an 𝔽_q-structure of 𝐆. Let C be an F-stable unipotent class and let u∈  C^F; we call C  the geometric class of  u and the 𝐆^F-classes inside  C^F  are  parameterized  by  the F-conjugacy classes of A(u), denoted  H^1(F,A(u)) (most of the time we can find u such that F acts trivially  on A(u) and H^1(F,A(u)) is then just the conjugacy classes). To  an F-stable character φ of  A(u) we associate the characteristic function  of  the  corresponding  local  system (actually associated to an extension  φ̃ of φ  to A(u).F); it  is a class  function Y_{u,φ} on 𝐆^F  which can be  normalized so that:  Y_{u,φ}(u₁)=φ̃(cF) if u₁ is geometrically  conjugate to u and its 𝐆^F-class is parameterized by the F-conjugacy class cF of A(u), otherwise Y_{u,φ}(u₁)=0. If the pair u,φ  corresponds via the Springer correspondence  to the character χ of W_𝐆(𝐋),  then Y_{u,φ} is also denoted Yᵪ. There is another important class of functions indexed by local systems: to a local system on class C is  attached  an  intersection  cohomology  complex,  which is a complex of sheaves  supported on  the closure  C̄. To  such a  complex of sheaves is associated  its  characteristic  function,  a  class  function  of  𝐆^F obtained  by taking  the alternating  trace of  the Frobenius acting on the stalks  of the cohomology sheaves. If  Y_ψ is the characteristic function of  a  local  system,  the  characteristic  function  of  the corresponding intersection  cohomology  complex  is  denoted  by  X_ψ. This function is supported  on C̄, and Lusztig has  shown that X_ψ=∑ᵩ P_{ψ,χ} Yᵪ where P_{ψ,χ}  are integer polynomials  in q and  Yᵪ are attached to local systems on classes lying in C̄.\n\nLusztig  and Shoji have given an algorithm to compute the matrix P_{ψ,χ}, which  is  implemented  in  Chevie.  The  relationship  with  characters of 𝐆(𝔽_q),  taking to simplify the ordinary Springer correspondence, is that the  restriction to the unipotent elements of the almost character R_χ is equal  to q^{bᵪ} Xᵪ, where bᵪ is dim  𝓑ᵤ for an element u of the class  C such  that the  support of  χ is  C̄. The restriction of the Deligne-Lusztig  characters R_w to  the unipotents are  called the Green functions  and can also be computed by Chevie. The values of all unipotent characters  on  unipotent  elements  can  also  be computed in principle by applying Lusztig's Fourier transform matrix (see the section on the Fourier matrix)  but  there  is  a  difficulty  in  that  the  Xᵪ  must be first multiplied  by some roots  of unity which  are not known  in all cases (and when  known may  depend on  the congruence  class of  q modulo some small primes).\n\nWe illustrate these computations on some examples:\n\njulia> UnipotentClasses(rootdatum(:sl,4))\nUnipotentClasses(A₃)\n1111<211<22<31<4\n   u│D-R dBu B-C     C(u) A₃(A₃₍₎) A₁(A₃₍₁₃₎=A₁×A₁)/-1 .(A₃)/ζ₄ .(A₃)/-ζ₄\n────┼─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\n4   │222   0 222    q³.Z₄      1:4                -1:2    ζ₄:Id    -ζ₄:Id\n31  │202   1 22.      q⁴.

The partial order on unipotent  classes given by Zariski closure  is given before the table. The column   'D-R',   displayed   only   in   good  characteristic,  gives  the Dynkin-Richardson  diagram  for  each  class;  the  column  'dBu' gives the dimension  of the  variety 𝓑ᵤ.  The column  'B-C' gives  the Bala-Carter classification  of u, that is in the case  of sl₄ it displays u as a regular  unipotent  in  a  Levi  subgroup  by  giving the Dynkin-Richardson diagram  of a regular  unipotent (all 2's)  at entries corresponding to the Levi  and '.' at  entries which do  not correspond to  the Levi. The column 'C(u)'  describes  the  group  C_𝐆(u):  a  power q^d describes that the unipotent  radical  of  C_𝐆(u)  has  dimension  d  (thus q^d rational points);  then follows a  description of the  reductive part of the neutral component  of  C_𝐆(u),  given  by  the  name  of  its root datum. Then if C_𝐆(u) is not connected, the description of A(u) is given using another vocabulary:  a cyclic group  of order 4  is given as  'Z4', and a symmetric group on 3 points would be given as 'S3'.\n\nFor instance, the first class '4' has C_𝐆(u)^0 unipotent of dimension 3 and  A(u) equal to 'Z4', the cyclic group  of order 4. The class '22' has C_G(u)  with unipotent radical  of dimension 4,  reductive part of type 'A1'  and A(u) is  'Z2', that is  the cyclic group  of order 2. The other classes  have C_𝐆(u) connected. For the  class '31' the reductive part of C_G(u) is a torus of rank 1.\n\nThen  there is one column for each Springer series, giving for each class the pairs 'a:b' where 'a' is the name of the character of A(u) describing the  local system  involved and  'b' is  the name  of the  character of the (relative)  Weyl group corresponding by the Springer correspondence. At the top  of the column is  written the name of  the relative Weyl group, and in brackets  the name  of the  Levi affording  a cuspidal  local system; next, separated  by a |/| is a description of the central character associated to the  Springer series  (omitted if  this central  character is trivial): all local  systems  in  a  given  Springer  series have same restriction to the center of 𝐆. To find what the picture becomes for another algebraic group in  the  same  isogeny  class,  for  instance the adjoint group, one simply discards the Springer series whose central character becomes trivial on the center  of 𝐆; and  each group A(u)  has to be  quotiented by the common kernel  of  the  remaining  characters.  Here  is the table for the adjoint group:\n\njulia> UnipotentClasses(coxgroup(:A,3))\nUnipotentClasses(A₃)\n1111<211<22<31<4\n   u│D-R dBu B-C  C(u) A₃(A₃₍₎)\n────┼───────────────────────────\n4   │222   0 222    q³     Id:4\n31  │202   1 22.   q⁴.

Also, from the 'B-C' column, we see that that class is not in a  proper Levi,  in which  case the  Bala-Carter diagram coincides with the Dynkin-Richardson diagram.\n\nThe  characteristics 2 and  3 are not  good for 'G2'.

We do not explain the details of this construction, but explain how its final result building Lusztig's Fourier matrix, and a variant of it that we use in Spetses, from Γ.\n\nThe  elements of the family are in bijection  with the set 𝓜 (Γ) of pairs (x,χ)  taken up to  Γ-conjugacy, where x∈Γ  and χ is an irreducible complex-valued   character  of  C_Γ(x).  To  such  a  pair  ρ=(x,χ)  is associated  an eigenvalue of Frobenius defined by ω_ρ:=χ(x)/χ(1). Lusztig then defines a Fourier matrix S₀ whose coefficient is given, for ρ=(x,χ) and ρ'=(x', χ'), by:\n\nS₀_{ρ,ρ'}:=#C_Γ(x)⁻¹ ∑_{ρ₁=(x₁,χ₁)}χ̄₁(x)χ(y₁)\n\nwhere the sum is over all pairs ρ₁∈𝓜 (Γ) which are Γ-conjugate to ρ' and  such that y₁∈  C_Γ(x). This coefficient  also represents the scalar product ⟨ρ,ρ'⟩_{𝐆^F} of the corresponding unipotent characters.\n\nA  way  to  understand  the  formula  for  S₀_{ρ,ρ'} better is to consider another  basis of the complex  vector space with basis  𝓜 (Γ), indexed by the  pairs  (x,y)  taken  up  to  Γ-conjugacy,  where  x  and y are commuting  elements  of  Γ.  This  basis  is  called  the basis of Mellin transforms, and given by:\n\n(x,y)=∑_{χ∈ Irr(C_Γ(x))}χ(y)(x,χ)\n\nIn  the  basis  of  Mellin  transforms,  the  linear  map  S₀ is given by (x,y)↦(x⁻¹,y⁻¹)  and  the  linear  transformation  T which sends ρ to ω_ρρ   becomes  (x,y)↦(x,xy).   These  are   particular  cases  of  the permutation  representation of GL_2(ℤ) on  the basis of Mellin transforms where (begin{array}{cc}a&b;c&d{array}) %begin{pmatrix}{cc}a&b;c&d{pmatrix} acts by (x,y)↦(x^ay^b,x^cy^d).\n\nFourier  matrices in finite reductive groups  are given by the above matrix S₀.  But for non-rational Spetses, we use  a different matrix S which in the  basis of Mellin transforms  is given by (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x). Equivalently, the  formula S_{ρ,ρ'}  differs from  the formula  for S₀_{ρ,ρ'}  in that there  is no complex conjugation of χ₁;  thus the matrix S is equal to S₀  multiplied on the right by the permutation matrix which corresponds to (x,χ)↦(x,χ̄).  The advantage of the matrix S  over S₀ is that the pair S,T  satisfies directly the axioms for a fusion algebra (see below); also the matrix S is symmetric, while S₀ is Hermitian.\n\nThus there are two variants of 'DrinfeldDouble`:\n\nDrinfeldDouble(<g>,rec(lusztig:=true))\n\nreturns  a family  containing Lusztig's  Fourier matrix  S₀, and  an extra field  '.perm'  containing  the  permutation  of  the  indices  induced  by (x,χ)↦(x,χ̄),  which allows  to recover  S, as  well as  an extra field `:lusztig', set to 'true'.\n\nDrinfeldDouble(<g>)\n\nreturns a family with the matrix S, which does not have fields '.lusztig' or '.perm'.\n\nThe family record 'f' returned also has the fields:\n\n:group: the group Γ.\n\n:charLabels: a list of labels describing the pairs (x,χ), and thus also specifying in which order they are taken.\n\n:fourierMat: the Fourier matrix (the matrix S or S₀ depending on the call).\n\n:eigenvalues: the eigenvalues of Frobenius.\n\n:xy: a list of pairs '[x,y]' which are representatives of the Γ-orbits of pairs of commuting elements.\n\n:mellinLabels: a list of labels describing the pairs '[x,y]'.\n\n:mellin:  the base change matrix between  the basis (x,χ) and the basis of   Mellin  transforms,   so  that   |f.fourierMat^(f.mellin^-1)|  is  the permutation  matrix (for (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x)  or (x,y)↦(y⁻¹,x⁻¹) depending on the call).\n\n:special: the index of the special element, which is (x,χ)=(1,1).\n\n|    gap> f:=DrinfeldDouble(SymmetricGroup(3));     Family(\"D(Group((1,3),(2,3)))\")     gap> Display(f);     D(Group((1,3),(2,3)))        label |eigen     _______________________________________________________     (1,1)    |    1 1/6  1/6  1/3  1/2  1/2  1/3  1/3  1/3     (1,X.2)  |    1 1/6  1/6  1/3 -1/2 -1/2  1/3  1/3  1/3     (1,X.3)  |    1 1/3  1/3  2/3    0    0 -1/3 -1/3 -1/3     (2a,1)   |    1 1/2 -1/2    0  1/2 -1/2    0    0    0     (2a,X.2) |   -1 1/2 -1/2    0 -1/2  1/2    0    0    0     (3a,1)   |    1 1/3  1/3 -1/3    0    0  2/3 -1/3 -1/3     (3a,X.2) |   E3 1/3  1/3 -1/3    0    0 -1/3 -1/3  2/3     (3a,X.3) | E3^2 1/3  1/3 -1/3    0    0 -1/3  2/3 -1/3     gap> f:=DrinfeldDouble(SymmetricGroup(3),rec(lusztig:=true));     Family(\"LD(Group((1,3),(2,3)))\")     gap> Display(f);     LD(Group((1,3),(2,3)))        label |eigen     _______________________________________________________     (1,1)    |    1 1/6  1/6  1/3  1/2  1/2  1/3  1/3  1/3     (1,X.2)  |    1 1/6  1/6  1/3 -1/2 -1/2  1/3  1/3  1/3     (1,X.3)  |    1 1/3  1/3  2/3    0    0 -1/3 -1/3 -1/3     (2a,1)   |    1 1/2 -1/2    0  1/2 -1/2    0    0    0     (2a,X.2) |   -1 1/2 -1/2    0 -1/2  1/2    0    0    0     (3a,1)   |    1 1/3  1/3 -1/3    0    0  2/3 -1/3 -1/3     (3a,X.2) |   E3 1/3  1/3 -1/3    0    0 -1/3  2/3 -1/3     (3a,X.3) | E3^2 1/3  1/3 -1/3    0    0 -1/3 -1/3  2/3|\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"#Gapjm.HasType.Family","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Gapjm.HasType.Family","text":"Family(f [, charNumbers [, opt]])\n\nThis function creates a new family in two possible ways.\n\nIn  the first case f is a string which denotes a family known to  CHEVIE.

There  are  several  interesting  cases  where  the relative group N_W(Lwϕ)/L, or a subgroup of it normalizing some further data attached to L, is itself a reflection group.\n\nA first example is the case where ϕ=1 and w=1, W is the Weyl group of a finite reductive group 𝐆^F and the Levi subgroup 𝐋^F corresponding to L  has a cuspidal unipotent character. Then N_W(L)/L is a Coxeter group acting  on the  space X(Z𝐋)⊗ℝ.  A combinatorial  characterization of such parabolic  subgroups of Coxeter  groups is that  they are normalized by the longest element of larger parabolic subgroups (see cite[5.7.1]{Lus76}).\n\nA  second  example  is  when  L  is  trivial  and  wϕ is a ζ-regular element,  that  is  the  ζ-eigenspace  V_ζ  of  wϕ contains a vector outside all the reflecting hyperplanes of W. Then N_W(Lwϕ)/L=C_W(wϕ) is a reflection group in its action on V_ζ.\n\nA  similar but more general example is  when V_ζ is the ζ-eigenspace of some  element of  the reflection  coset Wϕ,  and is  of maximal dimension among such possible ζ-eigenspaces. Then the set of elements of Wϕ which act  by ζ  on V_ζ  is a  certain subcoset  Lwϕ, and N_W(Lwϕ)/L is a reflection group in its action on V_ζ (see cite[2.5]{LS99}).\n\nFinally,  a  still  more  general  example,  but which only occurs for Weyl groups  or  Spetsial  reflection  groups,  is  when 𝐋 is a ζ-split Levi subgroup  (which means that  the corresponding subcoset  Lwϕ is formed of all  the elements which act by ζ on  some subspace V_ζ of V), and λ is  a  d-cuspidal  unipotent  character  of  𝐋  (which  means  that the multiplicity  of ζ  as a  root of  the degree  of λ  is the same as the multiplicity  of ζ as a root of the generic order of the semi-simple part of 𝐆); then N_W(Lwϕ,λ)/L is a complex reflection group in its action on V_ζ.\n\nFurther,  in the above cases the relative group describes the decomposition of a Lusztig induction.\n\nWhen  𝐆^F  is  a  finite  reductive  group,  and λ a cuspidal unipotent character  of the Levi subgroup  𝐋^F, then the 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra of  the Harish-Chandra induced representation R_𝐋^𝐆(λ) is a Hecke algebra attached  to the group N_W(L)/L, thus  the dimension of the characters of this group describe the multiplicities in the Harish-Chandra induced.\n\nSimilarly, when 𝐋 is a ζ-split Levi subgroup, and λ is a d-cuspidal unipotent  character  of  𝐋  then  (conjecturally) the 𝐆^F-endomorphism algebra of the Lusztig induced R_𝐋^𝐆(λ) is a cyclotomic Hecke algebra for to  the group N_W(Lwϕ,λ)/L.  The constituents of  R_𝐋^𝐆(λ) are called a ζ-Harish-Chandra  series.  In  the  case  of  rational  groups or cosets, corresponding  to  finite  reductive  groups,  the conjugacy class of Lwϕ depends only on the order d of ζ, so one also talks of d-Harish-Chandra  series. These series correspond to ℓ-blocks where l is  a prime divisor of Φ_d(q) which  does not divide any other cyclotomic factor of the order of 𝐆^F.\n\nThe functions described in this module allow to explore these situations.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#Gapjm.Eigenspaces.relative_degrees","page":"Gapjm.jl Documentation","title":"Gapjm.Eigenspaces.relative_degrees","text":"relative_degrees(WF,d=0)\n\nLet  WF be a reflection group or a reflection coset.
