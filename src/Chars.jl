The  `CharTable` of a finite complex reflection group `W` is computed using
the  decomposition of `W` in irreducible  groups (see `refltype`). For each
irreducible  group the character  table is either  computed using recursive
formulas  for the infinite series,  or read into the  system from a library
file  for the  exceptional types.  Thus, character  tables can  be obtained
quickly  even for very large groups  (e.g., E‚Çà). Similar remarks apply for
conjugacy classes.

The  conjugacy  classes  and  irreducible  characters of irreducible finite
complex reflection groups have canonical labelings by certain combinatorial
objects;  these labelings are used in the  tables we give. For the classes,
these  are partitions or partition tuples  for the infinite series, or, for
exceptional  Coxeter  groups,  Carter's  admissible  diagrams [@Car72]; for
other  primitive  complex  reflection  groups  we  just  use  words  in the
generators  to specify  the classes.  For the  characters, these  are again
partitions  or partition tuples for the infinite series, and for the others
they  are pairs  of two  integers `(d,e)`  where `d`  is the  degree of the
character  and  `e`  is  the  smallest  symmetric  power  of the reflection
representation  containing  the  given  character  as  a  constituent  (the
`b`-invariant  of the character). This information is obtained by using the
functions `classinfo` and `charinfo`. When you display the character table,
the canonical labelings for classes and characters are those displayed.

A  typical example  is `coxgroup(:A,n)`,  the symmetric  group `ùîñ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ` where
classes and characters are parameterized by partitions of `n+1`.

Recall  that our groups acts a reflection group on the vector space `V`, so
have  fake degrees  (see "fakeDegree").  The valuation  and degree of these
give  two  integers  `b,B`  for  each  irreducible  character  of  `W` (see
`charinf(W)[:b]`  and  `charinfo(W)[:B]`).  For  finite Coxeter groups, the
valuation  and degree of  the generic degrees  of the one-parameter generic
Hecke  algebra  give  two  more  integers  `a,A` (see `charinfo(W)[:a]` and
`charinfo(W)[:A]`,  and [@Car85, Ch.11] for  more details). These will also
be  used in the operations of truncated inductions explained in the chapter
"Reflection subgroups".

Iwahori-Hecke  algebras and  cyclotomic Hecke  algebras also have character
tables, see the corresponding chapters.

We  now describe for each type our conventions for labeling the classes and
characters.

Type  `A‚Çô` (`n‚â•0`). In this  case we have  `W ‚âÖ ùîñ‚Çô‚Çä‚ÇÅ`. The classes and
characters  are labeled by partitions of `n+1`. The partition corresponding
to  a class describes  the cycle type  for the elements  in that class; the
representative   in  '.classtext'   is  the   concatenation  of  the  words
corresponding  to each part, and to a part `i` is associated the product of
`i-1`  consecutive generators (starting one  higher that the last generator
used  for the previous  parts). The partition  corresponding to a character
describes  the type of  the Young subgroup  such that the trivial character
induced  from this  subgroup contains  that character with multiplicity `1`
and such that every other character occurring in this induced character has
a  higher `a`-value. Thus, the sign  character corresponds to the partition
`(1‚Åø‚Å∫¬π)`  and  the  trivial  character  to  the  partition  `(n+1)`. The
character of the reflection representation of `W` is labeled by `(n,1)`.

Type  `B‚Çô` (`n‚â•2`). In this  case `W=W(B‚Çô)` is  isomorphic to the wreath
product  of the cyclic  group of order  `2` with the  symmetric group `ùîñ‚Çô`.
Hence  the classes and characters are  parameterized by pairs of partitions
such  that the total sum of their  parts equals `n`. The pair corresponding
to  a class describes the signed cycle type for the elements in that class,
as  in [@Car72]. We use the convention that  if `(Œª,Œº)` is such a pair then
`Œª`  corresponds  to  the  positive  and  `Œº` to the negative cycles. Thus,
`(1‚Åø,-)`  and `(-,1‚Åø)` label the trivial class and the class containing the
longest  element, respectively.  The pair  corresponding to  an irreducible
character is determined via Clifford theory, as follows.

We  have a semidirect product decomposition `W(B‚Çô)=N ‚ãä ùîñ‚Çô` where `N` is the
standard  `n`-dimensional  `ùîΩ‚ÇÇ‚Åø`-vector  space.  For  `a,b  ‚â•  0` such that
`n=a+b` let `Œ∑_{a,b}` be the irreducible character of `N` which takes value
`1`  on the first `a` standard basis vectors and value `-1` on the next `b`
standard  basis vectors of `N`. Then  the inertia subgroup of `Œ∑_{a,b}` has
the  form `T_{a,b}=N.(ùîñ_a √ó ùîñ_b)` and  we can extend `Œ∑_{a,b}` trivially to
an  irreducible  character  `Œ∑ÃÉ_{a,b}`  of  `T_{a,b}`.  Let  `Œ±` and `Œ≤` be
partitions  of `a` and `b`, respectively. We take the tensor product of the
corresponding  irreducible characters of `ùîñ_a` and `ùîñ_b` and regard this as
an  irreducible  character  of  `T_{a,b}`.  Multiplying this character with
`Œ∑ÃÉ_{a,b}`  and  inducing  to  `W(B‚Çô)`  yields an irreducible character `œá=
œá_{(Œ±,Œ≤)}`  of `W(B‚Çô)`. This defines the correspondence between irreducible
characters and pairs of partitions as above.

For example, the pair `((n),-)` labels the trivial character and `(-,(1‚Åø))`
labels  the  sign  character.  The  character  of  the  natural  reflection
representation is labeled by `((n-1),(1))`.

Type  `D‚Çô` (`n‚â•4`). In this case `W=W(D‚Çô)` can be embedded as a subgroup of
index  `2` into the Coxeter  group `W(B‚Çô)`. The intersection  of a class of
`W(B‚Çô)` with `W(D‚Çô)` is either empty or a single class in `W(D‚Çô)` or splits
up  into two classes in  `W(D‚Çô)`. This also leads  to a parameterization of
the  classes of `W(D‚Çô)` by pairs of  partitions `(Œª,Œº)` as before but where
the  number of parts of `Œº` is even and where there are two classes of this
type  if `Œº` is empty and all parts of  `Œª` are even. In the latter case we
denote  the two classes in `W(D‚Çô)` by `(Œª,+)` and `(Œª,-)`, where we use the
convention  that  the  class  labeled  by `(Œª,+)` contains a representative
which  can be written  as a word  in `{s‚ÇÅ,s‚ÇÉ,‚Ä¶,s‚Çô}` and  `(Œª,-)` contains a
representative which can be written as a word in `{s‚ÇÇ,s‚ÇÉ, ‚Ä¶,s‚Çô}`.

By  Clifford theory the restriction of  an irreducible character of `W(B‚Çô)`
to  `W(D‚Çô)`  is  either  irreducible  or  splits  up  into  two irreducible
components.  Let `(Œ±,Œ≤)` be  a pair of  partitions with total  sum of parts
equal to `n`. If `Œ±!=Œ≤` then the restrictions of the irreducible characters
of  `W(B‚Çô)` labeled  by `(Œ±,Œ≤)`  and `(Œ≤,Œ±)`  are irreducible and equal. If
`Œ±=Œ≤`  then the restriction of the character labeled by `(Œ±,Œ±)` splits into
two  irreducible components  which we  denote by  `(Œ±,+)` and `(Œ±,-)`. Note
that  this can only happen if `n` is  even. In order to fix the notation we
use  a result of  [@Ste89] which describes  the value of  the difference of
these  two  characters  on  a  class  of  the  form `(Œª,+)` in terms of the
character  values  of  the  symmetric  group  `ùîñ_{n/2}`.  Recall that it is
implicit  in the notation `(Œª,+)` that all  parts of `Œª` are even. Let `Œª'`
be  the partition of `n/2` obtained by  dividing each part by `2`. Then the
value  of `œá_{(Œ±,-)}-œá_{(Œ±,+)}` on an element in the class `(Œª,+)` is given
by  `2^{k(Œª)}` times  the value  of the  irreducible character of `ùîñ_{n/2}`
labeled  by `Œ±` on the class of  cycle type `Œª'`. (Here, `k(Œª)` denotes the
number of non-zero parts of `Œª`.)

The  labels for the trivial, the  sign and the natural reflection character
are the same as for `W(B‚Çô)`, since these characters are restrictions of the
corresponding characters of `W(B‚Çô)`.

The groups `G(d,1,n)`.
They  are isomorphic to the wreath product of the cyclic group of order `d`
with  the  symmetric  group  `ùîñ‚Çô`.  Hence  the  classes  and characters are
parameterized  by `d`-tuples of partitions such that the total sum of their
parts  equals `n`. The words chosen  as representatives of the classes are,
when `d>2`, computed in a slightly different way than for `B‚Çô`, in order to
agree  with the words on which Ram  and Halverson compute the characters of
the  Hecke algebra. First the parts of the `d` partitions are merged in one
big  partition and sorted in  increasing order. Then, to  a part `i` coming
from  the `j`-th partition is  associated the word `(l+1‚Ä¶1‚Ä¶ l+1) ≤‚Åª¬πl+2‚Ä¶l+i`
where `l` is the highest generator used to express the previous part.

The  `d`-tuple corresponding to an  irreducible character is determined via
Clifford  theory in  a similar  way than  for the  `B‚Çô` case.  The identity
character  has the first  partition with one  part equal `n`  and the other
ones  empty. The character of the  reflection representations has the first
two  partitions with one part  equal respectively to `n-1`  and to `1`, and
the other partitions empty.

The groups `G(de,e,n)`.
They  are normal  subgroups of  index `e`  in `G(de,1,n)`.  The quotient is
cyclic,  generated by the image `g`  of the first generator of `G(de,1,n)`.
The  classes are parameterized as the  classes of `G(de,e,n)` with an extra
information for a component of a class which splits.

According  to  [@Hu85],  a  class  `C`  of  `G(de,1,n)`  parameterized by a
`de`-partition  `(S‚ÇÄ,‚Ä¶,S_{de-1})` is  in `G(de,e,n)`  if `e`  divides `‚àë·µ¢ i
‚àë_{p‚àà  S·µ¢}p`. It splits in `d` classes for the largest `d` dividing `e` and
all  parts of all `S·µ¢` and  such that `S·µ¢` is empty  if `d` does not divide
`i`.  If `w` is in `C` then 'g‚Å± w g‚Åª‚Å±' for 'i in 0:d-1' are representatives
of  the  classes  of  `G(de,e,n)`  which  meet  `C`.  They are described by
appending the integer `i` to the label for `C`.

The  characters are described by Clifford theory. We make `g` act on labels
for  characters of `G(de,1,n)`  . The action  of `g` permutes circularly by
`d`  the partitions in the `de`-tuple.  A character has same restriction to
`G(de,e,n)`  as its transform by `g`.  The number of irreducible components
of its restriction is equal to the order `k` of its stabilizer under powers
of  `g`.  We  encode  a  character  of  `G(de,e,n)`  by first, choosing the
smallest  for lexicographical order label  of a character whose restriction
contains  it; then this label is periodic with a motive repeated `k` times;
we  represent the  character by  one of  these motives,  to which we append
`E(k)‚Å±` for 'i in 0:k-1' to describe which component of the restriction we
choose.

Types  `G‚ÇÇ` and `F‚ÇÑ`. The matrices  of character values and the orderings
and  labelings of  the irreducible  characters are  exactly the  same as in
[@Car85,  p.412/413]: in type `G‚ÇÇ` the character `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÉ'` takes the value -1
on  the reflection associated  to the long  simple root; in  type `F‚ÇÑ`, the
characters  `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ'`, `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÑ'`, `œÜ‚ÇÑ,‚Çá'`, `œÜ‚Çà,‚Çâ'` and `œÜ‚Çâ,‚ÇÜ'` occur in the
induced  of the  identity from  the `A‚ÇÇ`  corresponding to the short simple
roots;  the  pairs  (`œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ'`,  `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÑ‚Ä≥`)  and  (`œÜ‚Çà,‚ÇÉ'`, `œÜ‚Çà,‚Çâ‚Ä≥`) are
related by tensoring by sign; and finally `œÜ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÜ‚Ä≥` is the exterior square
of  the reflection representation. Note, however, that we put the long root
at the left of the Dynkin diagrams to be in accordance with the conventions
in [@Lus85, (4.8) and (4.10)].

The  classes  are  labeled  by  Carter's  admissible  diagrams  [@Car72]. A
character is labeled by a pair `(d,b)` where `d` denotes the degree and `b`
the  corresponding `b`-invariant. If there  are several characters with the
same pair `(d,b)` we attach a prime to them, as in [@Car85].

Types  `E‚ÇÜ,E‚Çá,E‚Çà`. The character tables are obtained by specialization of
those  of the Hecke algebra. The classes are labeled by Carter's admissible
diagrams  [@Car72]. A  character is  labeled by  the pair `(d,b)` where `d`
denotes  the degree and  `b` is the  corresponding `b`-invariant. For these
types, this gives a unique labeling of the characters.

Non-crystallographic  types `I‚ÇÇ(m)`, `H‚ÇÉ`, `H‚ÇÑ`. In these cases we do not
have  canonical  labelings  for  the  classes.  We  label  them  by reduced
expressions.

Each  character for  type `H‚ÇÉ`  is uniquely  determined by the pair `(d,b)`
where  `d` is the degree and  `b` the corresponding `b`-invariant. For type
`H‚ÇÑ`  there are just  two characters (those  of degree `30`)  for which the
corresponding  pairs are  the same.  These two  characters are nevertheless
distinguished  by  their  fake  degrees:  the  character `œÜ‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ'` has fake
degree  `q¬π‚Å∞+q¬π¬≤+` higher terms, while `œÜ‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚Ä≥` has fake degree `q¬π‚Å∞+q¬π‚Å¥+`
higher  terms. The characters in the table for type `H‚ÇÑ` are ordered in the
same way as in [@AL82].

Finally,  the characters  of degree `2`  for type  `I‚ÇÇ(m)` are  ordered as
follows.  The matrix representations affording the characters of degree `2`
are given by:
` œÅ_j : s‚ÇÅs‚ÇÇ ‚Ü¶
(\\begin{array}{cc}E(m)^j&0\\0&E(m)^{-j}\\end{array}),
 s‚ÇÅ‚Ü¶(\\begin{array}{cc}0&1\\1&0\\end{array}),`
where  `1 ‚â§ j ‚â§  ‚åä(m-1)/2‚åã`. The reflection representation
is  `œÅ‚ÇÅ`. The  characters in  the table  are ordered by listing
first the characters of degree 1 and then `œÅ‚ÇÅ,œÅ‚ÇÇ,‚Ä¶`.

Primitive complex reflection groups `G‚ÇÑ` to `G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÑ`.
The  groups `G‚ÇÇ‚ÇÉ=H‚ÇÉ`, `G‚ÇÇ‚Çà=F‚ÇÑ`, `G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ=H‚ÇÑ` are exceptional Coxeter groups and
have  been  explained  above.  Similarly  for  the  other groups labels for
characters  consist primarily  of the  pair `(d,b)`  where `d`  denotes the
degree  and `b` is the corresponding  `b`-invariant. This is sufficient for
`G‚ÇÑ`,  `G‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ`, `G‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ` and `G‚ÇÇ‚ÇÑ`. For other  groups there are pairs or triples
of  characters which  have the  same `(d,b)`  value. We  disambiguate these
according  to  the  conventions  of  [@Mal00]  for `G‚ÇÇ‚Çá, G‚ÇÇ‚Çâ, G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÅ, G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ` and
`G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÑ`:

-  For `G‚ÇÇ‚Çá`:
The  fake degree  of `œÜ‚ÇÉ,‚ÇÖ'`  (resp. `œÜ‚ÇÉ,‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ'`,  `œÜ‚Çà,‚Çâ‚Ä≥`) has smaller degree
that  of  `œÜ‚ÇÉ,‚ÇÖ‚Ä≥`  (resp.  `œÜ‚ÇÉ,‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ‚Ä≥`,  `œÜ‚Çà,‚Çâ'`). The characters `œÜ‚ÇÖ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ'` and
`œÜ‚ÇÖ,‚ÇÜ'` occur with multiplicity 1 in the induced from the trivial character
of  the parabolic subgroup  of type `A‚ÇÇ`  generated by the  first and third
generator  (it is  asserted mistakenly  in [@Mal00]  that `œÜ‚ÇÖ,‚ÇÜ‚Ä≥`  does not
occur in this induced; it occurs with multiplicity 2).

-  For `G‚ÇÇ‚Çâ`:
The  character  `œÜ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚Ä¥`  is  the  exterior  square  of `œÜ‚ÇÑ,‚ÇÅ`; its complex
conjugate  is `œÜ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚Åó`. The  character `œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ,‚ÇÑ‚Ä≥` occurs  in `œÜ‚ÇÑ,‚ÇÅ‚äóœÜ‚ÇÑ,‚ÇÉ`; the
character  `œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ‚Ä≥`  is  tensored  by  the  sign  character from `œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ,‚ÇÑ‚Ä≥`.
Finally  `œÜ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ'` occurs in  the induced from  the trivial character of the
standard parabolic subgroup of type `A‚ÇÉ` generated by the first, second and
fourth generators.

-  For `G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÅ`:
The  characters `œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ,‚Çà'`, `œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ,‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ'` and `œÜ‚ÇÑ‚ÇÖ,‚Çà‚Ä≥` occur in `œÜ‚ÇÑ,‚ÇÅ‚äóœÜ‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ,‚Çá`; the
character   `œÜ‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉ'`  is  complex  conjugate  of  `œÜ‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ,‚Çá`;  the  character
`œÜ‚ÇÑ‚ÇÖ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ'`  is tensored by sign of `œÜ‚ÇÑ‚ÇÖ,‚Çà'`. The two terms of maximal degree
of  the fakedegree of `œÜ‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ'` are  `q‚Åµ‚Å∞+q‚Å¥‚Å∂` while for `œÜ‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚Ä≥` they are
`q‚Åµ‚Å∞+2q‚Å¥‚Å∂`.

-  For `G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ`:
The  terms of  maximal degree  of the  fakedegree of `œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ,‚Çà'` are `q¬≤‚Å∏+q¬≤‚Å∂`
while  for `œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ,‚Çà'` they are `q¬≤‚Å∏+q¬≤‚Å¥`. The  terms of maximal degree of the
fakedegree   of  `œÜ‚ÇÑ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÖ'`  are  `q¬≥¬π+q¬≤‚Åπ`   while  for  `œÜ‚ÇÑ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÖ‚Ä≥`  they  are
`q¬≥¬π+2q¬≤‚Åπ`.  The character  `œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚Çá'` is  tensored by  sign of `œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ,‚Çà'` and
`œÜ‚ÇÑ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÑ'` is tensored by sign of `œÜ‚ÇÑ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÖ'`.

-  For `G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÑ`:
The  character `œÜ‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ'` occurs in `œÜ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÅ‚äóœÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÑ`. The character `œÜ‚Çá‚ÇÄ,‚Çâ'` is
rational.  The character  `œÜ‚Çá‚ÇÄ,‚Çâ‚Ä≥` occurs  in `œÜ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÅ‚äóœÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÑ`.  The character
`œÜ‚Çá‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÑ‚ÇÖ'`   is  rational.The   character  `œÜ‚Çá‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÑ‚ÇÖ‚Ä≥`   is  tensored  by  the
determinant  character of  `œÜ‚Çá‚ÇÄ,‚Çâ‚Ä≥`. The  character `œÜ‚ÇÖ‚ÇÜ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚Çà'` is rational.
The character `œÜ‚ÇÖ‚ÇÜ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚Çà‚Ä¥` occurs in `œÜ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÅ‚äóœÜ‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÅ‚Çá`. The character `œÜ‚ÇÇ‚Çà‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ'`
occurs    in   `œÜ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÅ‚äóœÜ‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÅ‚Çá`.   The   character   `œÜ‚ÇÇ‚Çà‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÉ‚ÇÄ‚Ä≥`   occurs   in
`œÜ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÅ‚äóœÜ‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÅ‚Çá`.  The  character  `œÜ‚ÇÖ‚ÇÑ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÇ‚ÇÅ'`  occurs  in `œÜ‚ÇÜ,‚ÇÅ‚äóœÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÖ,‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ`. The
character  `œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÖ,‚Çà'` is  complex conjugate  of `œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ‚ÇÖ,‚ÇÑ`,  and `œÜ‚Çà‚ÇÑ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉ'` is
complex  conjugate  of  `œÜ‚Çà‚ÇÑ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ`.  The  character  `œÜ‚Çà‚ÇÑ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÇ‚ÇÉ'`  is  complex
conjugate  of  `œÜ‚Çà‚ÇÑ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÅ‚Çâ`.  Finally  `œÜ‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ‚ÇÄ,‚ÇÇ‚ÇÅ'`  occurs  in induced from the
trivial character of the standard parabolic subgroup of type `A‚ÇÖ` generated
by the generators of `G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÑ` with the third one omitted.

For  the groups `G‚ÇÖ` and `G‚Çá` we  adopt the following conventions. For `G‚ÇÖ`
they are compatible with those of [@MR03] and [@BMM14].

-  For `G‚ÇÖ`:
We  let `W=ComplexReflectionGroup(5)`,  so the  generators are  `W(1)` and
`W(2)`.

The  character `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÑ'` (resp. `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ'`, `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÉ'`) takes the value `1` (resp.
`Œ∂‚ÇÉ`,  `-Œ∂‚ÇÉ`)  on  `W(1)`.  The  character  `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚Çà‚Ä≥` is complex conjugate to
`œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ`,  and the character  `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚Çà'` is complex  conjugate to `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÑ'` . The
character  `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÖ‚Ä≥` is complex  conjugate to `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÅ`;  `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÖ'` take the value
`-1` on `W(1)`. The character `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚Çá'` is complex conjugate to `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÖ'`.

-  For `G‚Çá`:
We  let `W=ComplexReflectionGroup(7)`,  so the  generators are
`W(1)`, `W(2)` and `W(3)`.

The  characters  `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÑ'`  and  `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ'`  take  the value `1` on `W(2)`. The
character  `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚Çà‚Ä≥` is complex  conjugate to `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÜ`  and `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚Çà'` is complex
conjugate  to `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÑ'`. The characters `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÇ'`  and `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÅ‚Çà'` take the value
`Œ∂‚ÇÉ`  on `W(2)`. The character `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÑ‚Ä≥` is complex conjugate to `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÇ‚ÇÇ` and
`œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÑ'`  is complex conjugate to `œÜ‚ÇÅ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÄ'`. The character `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÉ'` takes the
value  `-Œ∂‚ÇÉ` on  `W(2)` and  `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉ'` takes  the value  `-1` on `W(2)`. The
characters  `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ‚Ä≥`, `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÖ‚Ä≥`, `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚Çá‚Ä¥` and  `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÅ` are Galois conjugate, as
well  as  the  characters  `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚Çá'`,  `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉ'`,  `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ'`  and  `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÖ'`. The
character  `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚Çâ'` is complex  conjugate to `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÅ‚ÇÖ`  and `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚Çâ‚Ä¥` is complex
conjugate to `œÜ‚ÇÇ,‚ÇÉ'`.

Finally,  for the remaining groups `G‚ÇÜ, G‚Çà`  to `G‚ÇÅ‚ÇÅ, G‚ÇÅ‚ÇÉ` to `G‚ÇÇ‚ÇÅ`, `G‚ÇÇ‚ÇÖ`,
`G‚ÇÇ‚ÇÜ`,  `G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÇ` and `G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ` there are only  pairs of characters with same value
`(d,b)`.  We give labels uniformly to these characters by applying in order
the following rules :

-  If the two characters have  different fake degrees, label `œÜ_{d,b}'` the
   one  whose  fake  degree  is  minimal  for  the  lexicographic  order of
   polynomials (starting with the highest term).

-  For the not yet labeled pairs, if only one of the two characters has the
   property   that  in  its   Galois  orbit  at   least  one  character  is
   distinguished by its `(d,b)`-invariant, label it `œÜ_{d,b}'`.

-  For the not yet labeled pairs,  if the minimum of the `(d,b)`-value (for
   the  lexicographic  order  `(d,b)`)  in  the  Galois  orbits  of the two
   character  is different, label `œÜ_{d,b}'` the character with the minimal
   minimum.

-  We define now a new invariant  for characters: consider all the pairs of
   irreducible   characters  `œá`  and  `œà`  uniquely  determined  by  their
   `(d,b)`-invariant such that `œÜ` occurs with non-zero multiplicity `m` in
   `œá‚äóœà`.  We define  `t(œÜ)` to  be the  minimal (for  lexicographic order)
   possible list `(d(œá),b(œá),d(œà),b(œà),m)`.

For  the not  yet labeled  pairs, if  the t-invariants are different, label
`œÜ_{d,b}'` the character with the minimal `t`-invariant.

After  applying  the  last  rule  all  the  pairs  will be labelled for the
considered  groups. The labelling obtained  is compatible for `G‚ÇÇ‚ÇÖ`, `G‚ÇÇ‚ÇÜ`,
`G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÇ`  and `G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÉ` with that of [@Mal00]  and for `G‚Çà` with that described in
[@MR03].

We  should  emphasize  that  for  all  groups  with  a  few exceptions, the
parameters  for characters do  not depend on  any non-canonical choice. The
exceptions  are `G(de,e,n)` with `e>1`, and `G‚ÇÖ`, `G‚Çá`, `G‚ÇÇ‚Çá`, `G‚ÇÇ‚Çà`, `G‚ÇÇ‚Çâ`
and  `G‚ÇÉ‚ÇÑ`, groups  which admit  outer automorphisms  preserving the set of
reflections,  so choices  of a  particular value  on a particular generator
must be made for characters which are not invariant by these automorphisms.

Labels  for the classes. For the exceptional complex reflection groups, the
labels  for the classes represent the  decomposition of a representative of
the  class as a product of generators, with the additional conventions that
'z'  represents the generator  of the center  and for well-generated groups
'c'  represents a Coxeter element  (a product of the  generators which is a
regular element for the highest reflection degree).

`charinfo(W)`

returns   information  about  the  irreducible  characters  of  the  finite
reflection group `W`. The result is a Dict with the following entries:

`:charparams`:  contains  parameters  for  the  irreducible  characters  as
described in the introduction. The parameters are tuples with one component
for  each irreducible  component of  `W` (as  given by  `refltype`). For an
irreducible   component  which  is  an  imprimitive  reflection  group  the
component  of the `charparam` is a tuple of partitions (partitions for type
`:A`,  double partitions  for type  `:B`), and  for a primitive irreducible
group it is a pair `(d,e)` where `d` is the degree of the character and `e`
is  the  smallest  symmetric  power  of  the  character  of  the reflection
representation  which  contains  the  given  character  as  a component. In
addition,  there is an ordinal number if more than one character shares the
first two invariants.

```julia-repl

 [[1, 6]]   
 [[1, 3, 1]]
 [[1, 3, 2]]
 [[2, 1]]   
 [[2, 2]]   
```

`:charnames`:  strings describing the  irreducible characters, computed from
the `charparams`. This is the same as `CharNames(W)`.

`:positionId`:  the position of the trivial character in the character table
of `W`.

```julia-repl
julia> charinfo(coxgroup(:D,4))[:positionId]
13
```

`:positionDet`:  Contains the position  of the determinant  character in the
character   table  of  `W`. For Coxeter groups this is the sign character.

```julia-repl
julia> charinfo(coxgroup(:D,4))[:positionDet]
4
```

`:extRefl`: Only present if `W` is irreducible, in which case the reflection
representation  of `W` and all its exterior powers are irreducible. It then
contains   the  position   of  the   exterior  powers   of  the  reflection
representation in the character table.

`:b`:   contains  a  list  holding  the  `b`-function  for  all  irreducible
characters  of `W`, that is,  for each character `œá`,  the valuation of the
fake  degree of `œá`. The ordering of the result corresponds to the ordering
of  the  characters  in  `CharTable(W)`.  The  advantage  of  this function
compared  to calling `fakeDegrees` is that one  does not have to provide an
indeterminate,  and that  it may  be much  faster to  compute than the fake
degrees.

Spetsial  reflection  group  `W`,  that  is,  for  each  character `œá`, the
valuation  of the generic degree of `œá` (in the one-parameter Hecke algebra
`Hecke(W,Pol(:q))`  corresponding  to  `W`).  The  ordering  of  the result

`:opdam`:  Contains the permutation of  the characters obtained by composing
the  Opdam  involution  with  complex  conjugation. This permutation has an
interpretation as a Galois action on the characters of
`H=Hecke(W,Pol(:x))`:  if `H` splits  by taking `v`  an `e`-th root of `x`,
`.opdam` records the permutation effected by the Galois action `v->E(e)*v`.

`:classtext`:  contains words in  the generators describing representatives

groups, it is the same as
`map(x->word(W,representative(x)),conjugacyclasses(W))`,   and   each  such
representative  is of minimal length in its  conjugacy class and is a "very
good" element in the sense of [@GM97].

`:classparams`:  The  elements  of  this  list  are  tuples  which have one
component  for each irreducible component of  `W`. These components for the
infinite  series,  contain  partitions  or  partition tuples describing the
class  (see  the  introduction).  For  the  exceptional Coxeter groups they
contain Carter's admissible diagrams, see [@Car72]. For exceptional complex

or WGraphToRepresentation(H,graph)
Chevie stores some representations of some equal-parameter Hecke algebras
as  `W`-graphs. For a Coxeter system `(W,S)`  a `W`-graph is defined by a
set  of vertices  `C`; to  `x‚àà C`  is attached  `I(x)‚äÇ S`  and to
`(x,y)‚àà  C^2`  is  attached  an  ``edge''  `Œº(x,y)`  in  the field of
definition  of `W`;  this defines  a representation  of the Hecke algebra
with single rootparameter `v` on a space with basis `e_y_{y‚àà C}` by:

  T_s(e_y)=cases{-e_y&                            if `s‚àà I(y)`\\
             v^2 e_y+‚àë_{x‚à£s‚àà I(x)} vŒº(x,y)e_x&otherwise\\}

The W-graphs  are stored in a  compact format to save  space. They are
represented  as a  pair. 
-The  first element is a list describing C; its elements are either a set
I(x),  or an integer n  specifying to repeat the  previous element n more
times.
-The  second element is a list which  specifies mu. We first describe the
mu-list  for symmetric  W-graphs (when  Œº(x,y)=Œº(y,x)). There  is one
element  of the  mu-list for  each non-zero  value m  taken by Œº, which
consists of a pair whose first element is m and whose second element is a
list  of  lists;  if  l  is  one  of  these  lists  each pair [l[1],l[i]]
represents  an  edge  (x=l[1],y=l[i])  such that Œº(x,y)=Œº(y,x)=m. For
non-symmetric  W-graphs, the first element of each pair in the mu-list is
a  pair [m1,m2] and each edge [x,y] obtained from the lists in the second
element has to be interpreted as mu(x,y)=m1 and mu(y,x)=m2.
